# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is an experimental demo repository showcasing autonomous GitHub workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. The project is actively evolving, and while core functionalities are demonstrated, users may encounter changes as new features are integrated. Contributions are welcome to stabilize and expand the system.

## Current State
- The software is in an experimental phase and is under active development.
- Core functionalities include a CLI tool that logs provided arguments and automated CI/CD workflows.
- Some features (e.g., detailed help commands and diagnostics) are minimal and expected to improve.
- Be aware that executing certain workflows (like those invoking OpenAI APIs) may incur costs.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**
  Automated workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory leverage reusable actions from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**
  The main functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`, which currently logs the CLI arguments.

- **Dependencies:**
  Managed via `package.json`, including core packages such as `openai`, `dotenv`, and testing utilities.

- **Tests:**
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder validate the basic module operations. See `tests/unit/main.test.js` for details.

- **Documentation:**
  This README is dynamically refreshed based on the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to reflect the current state and future directions of the software.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the tests with `npm test` to verify functionality.
4. Start the CLI tool with `npm run start` or view help with `node src/lib/main.js --help`.
5. For diagnostics, run `npm run diagnostics`.

## Contribution Steps (Granular for LLM Delivery)

1. Fork the repository and create a new feature branch.
2. Follow the inline code comments and documentation for guidance.
3. Validate changes locally by running:
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Test: `npm test`
   - Diagnostics: `npm run diagnostics`
4. Update tests and documentation as needed.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

This project integrates autonomous workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`, a collection of reusable GitHub Actions designed for self-evolving code. While experimental, these workflows continuously monitor, test, and update the repository. Please ensure you have the necessary API keys and monitor usage to avoid unintended costs.
