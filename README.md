# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is maintained to deliver core arithmetic operations with enhanced error handling. Recently, extended arithmetic operations (median, mode, standard deviation, and range) were added inline with the mission statement.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` defines dependencies and scripts for build, test, and workflow operations.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script behaves as expected and remains in line with repository goals.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` is updated to reflect the current functionality and best practices, aligning with our CONTRIBUTING guidelines.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key is required for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.

## Changelog
- Fixed exception handling in version retrieval and ensured compliance with linting rules.
- Extended arithmetic operations by adding median, mode, and standard deviation calculations inline with the mission statement.
- Extended arithmetic operation: Added range calculation (--range flag) to compute the difference between maximum and minimum values.
- Improved inline documentation to maintain clarity and testability.
