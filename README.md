# `repository0`

This repository is a template that showcases automated CI/CD workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. It provides a modular CLI demonstration with commands refactored into discrete functions for enhanced maintainability and ease of extension, and now includes a chat command integration with OpenAI's API as well as robust and standardized CLI input validation powered by Zod.

## Overview

`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and serve as an example for future development. The CLI functionality has been refactored to separate command registration into modular functions, improving maintainability. Package metadata is imported using Node's built-in createRequire, which avoids deprecated JSON import assertions.

## CLI Usage

The CLI employs yargs for robust subcommand parsing and improved input validation. Key subcommands include:

- **diagnostics:** Runs diagnostics and provides detailed environment information including Node.js version, package metadata, and dependency versions.
  - Example: `repository0 diagnostics`
- **version:** Displays the current version dynamically retrieved from package.json.
  - Example: `repository0 version`
- **update:** Initiates an update.
  - Example: `repository0 update`
- **config:** Displays configuration settings. Use the subcommand **show** to view the current configuration.
  - Example: `repository0 config show`
- **info:** Displays repository metadata including the repository name, version, and description.
  - Example: `repository0 info`
- **chat:** Interact with OpenAI's API by sending a prompt and receiving a generated response.
  - Example: `repository0 chat --prompt "Hello, how are you?"`

## CLI Input Validation

The CLI now validates all input arguments to ensure they are non-empty strings using Zod for enhanced type enforcement. Every invalid input produces a standardized error message following this pattern:

```
Invalid input: Expected a valid non-empty string command, but received <input>. Please provide a valid non-empty string, such as 'start' or 'info'.
```

Error messages have been refined to include explicit punctuation after the received input value for improved clarity.

## Error Handling Improvements

Error handling has been centralized to include a consistent prefix ("CLI Error:") for all error messages. This enhancement aids in debugging by clearly identifying CLI errors while preserving the original error information.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**
  GitHub workflows located in the `.github/workflows/` directory leverage reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` to automate project tasks.

- **Source Code:**
  The main functionality is provided in `src/lib/main.js`, which now uses Node's createRequire for importing package.json and includes enhanced CLI argument validation using Zod, as well as a new chat command that leverages the OpenAI API.

- **Dependencies:**
  The `package.json` file defines project dependencies and scripts for testing, formatting, linting, and CLI execution.

- **Tests:**
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder validate the CLI commands and error handling scenarios, ensuring robust behavior across a variety of input types.

- **Documentation:**
  This README provides essential project information. For contribution guidelines, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

This repository is set up with the necessary workflows and scripts. You need to supply the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - An account key with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

Set this secret in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows enabling your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. These workflows are designed to automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your projects. They are invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event and can be composed together like an SDK.

*Warning:* Running these workflows may incur resource usage and charges.
