# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals. Recent updates include diagnostic capabilities and a new greeting functionality.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies and defines scripts for building, testing, and running the application.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script operates as intended, now including tests for the new greeting functionality.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` can be modified by the workflow to reflect ongoing improvements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run tests with `npm test`.
4. Launch the CLI tool with `npm run start` or view help using `node src/lib/main.js --help`.
5. Run diagnostics with `npm run diagnostics` (this will output: "Diagnostics: All systems operational.").
6. Check the version with `npm run version`.
7. Display a greeting using `node src/lib/main.js --greet`.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows enabling autonomous development practices that continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code.

*Warning:* Running these workflows may consume GitHub Actions minutes and incur charges on your OpenAI account.

*Warning:* Experimental. Not recommended for production use.
