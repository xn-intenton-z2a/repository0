# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file handles a command-line interface supporting several flags, including:
    - `--help` for usage instructions,
    - `--version` to print the current version,
    - `--diagnostics` to check system operation,
    - `--greet` to display a greeting message,
    - `--sum` to calculate the sum of provided numbers,
    - `--multiply` to compute the product of provided numbers,
    - `--subtract` to subtract each subsequent number from the first provided number.

- **Default Behavior:**
  When no arguments are provided, the program displays a usage message followed by a demo output and exits. This ensures users see the intended instructions without needing further input.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies and defines test and build scripts (which may be updated by the workflows).

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure consistency of CLI behavior as implemented in `src/lib/main.js`.

- **Future Features:**
  Future enhancements may include more advanced mathematical operations, interactive mode support, integration with external APIs for enriched diagnostics, and further automation of deployment processes.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` is maintained and updated automatically by the CI/CD workflows.

## Getting Started

This repository is pre-configured with necessary workflows and scripts. To run the CLI demo, supply the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - Required for automated workflows interacting with the OpenAI API. Set this secret under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions* in your repository.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
