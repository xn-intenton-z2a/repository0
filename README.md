# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals. It now includes extended arithmetic features such as exponentiation chaining, factorial, and square root operations.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` can be modified by the workflow to add or update dependencies and it also defines some of the test and build scripts.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script behaves as expected. Recent updates have increased test coverage to near 100% and now cover edge cases for arithmetic functions including factorial (with 0 and negative values) and square root (with negative values).

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` is maintained to reflect current functionality and future improvements.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

### Usage Examples

Run the CLI application with different flags:
- Display help: `node src/lib/main.js --help`
- Get version: `node src/lib/main.js --version`
- Run diagnostics: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`
- Arithmetic operations examples:
  - Sum: `node src/lib/main.js --sum 1 2 3`
  - Multiply: `node src/lib/main.js --multiply 2 3 4`
  - Power (chained exponentiation): `node src/lib/main.js --power 2 3 2`
  - Factorial: `node src/lib/main.js --factorial 5`
  - Square Root: `node src/lib/main.js --sqrt 16`

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.

## Change Log
- Extended arithmetic features: Added exponentiation chaining, factorial, and square root operations to align with the mission statement and enhance utility.
- Increased test coverage to near 100% by adding tests for edge cases including factorial(0), factorial with negative input, and square root with negative input.
- Updated README examples to accurately reflect the supported CLI commands and usage.
