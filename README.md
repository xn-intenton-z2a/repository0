# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates automated workflows.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` demonstrates GitHub workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`, focusing on automated CI/CD and robust CLI operations. The source code in `src/lib/main.js` delivers a set of arithmetic and diagnostic functions with improved error handling and comprehensive testing.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory utilize reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` to automate project tasks.

- **Source Code:**  
  The CLI functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is maintained to align strictly with the project’s mission.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file defines dependencies and scripts for testing, formatting, linting, and running the CLI.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure the CLI's commands behave as expected.

- **Documentation:**  
  This README provides essential project information. For contribution guidelines, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable autonomous repository operations. These workflows, invoked through GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, work together like an SDK to continuously improve the project.

*Warning:* Running these workflows may incur resource usage and charges.

## Change Log
