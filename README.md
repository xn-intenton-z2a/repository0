# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and a CLI tool with various functionalities.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` enabling automated tests, builds, formatting, and issue management.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This CLI tool supports the following commands:
    - `--help`: Display detailed help instructions.
    - `--version`: Show the current version from package.json.
    - `--diagnostics`: Check system diagnostics.
    - `--greet`: Display a greeting message.
    - `--sum`: Compute the sum of provided numbers.
    - `--multiply`: Compute the product of provided numbers.
    - `--subtract`: Subtract each subsequent number from the first provided number.
  
  When no arguments are provided, the tool displays a usage message and a demo output indicating that no arguments were passed.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file lists dependencies required for running, testing, building, and formatting the project.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the CLI behaves as expected.

- **Documentation:**  
  This `README.md` file is kept in sync with the CLI's current behavior and planned enhancements.

## Getting Started

To run the CLI demo, execute:
```bash
npm run start [--help]
```

Supply the following secret in your repository settings:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` (required for automated workflows like publishing and diagnostics).

## Future Features

- **Interactive Mode:** A future update will introduce an interactive CLI mode to enhance user experience.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** More detailed system diagnostics and error reporting will be added.
- **Extended Math Operations:** Additional mathematical functionalities and robust validations are planned.
- **External API Integrations:** Future versions may interface with external services for enriched functionality.
