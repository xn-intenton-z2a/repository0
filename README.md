# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and now includes extended arithmetic operations such as exponentiation chaining, factorial, and square root computations.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` can be modified by the workflow to add or update dependencies and it also defines some of the test and build scripts.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script behaves as expected, with near 100% coverage for various arithmetic operations and edge cases.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` is maintained to reflect current functionality and planned improvements.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

### Usage Examples

Run the CLI application with different flags:
- Display help: `node src/lib/main.js --help`
- Get version: `node src/lib/main.js --version`
- Run diagnostics: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`
- Arithmetic operations examples:
  - Sum: `node src/lib/main.js --sum 1 2 3`
  - Multiply: `node src/lib/main.js --multiply 2 3 4`
  - Power (chained exponentiation): `node src/lib/main.js --power 2 3 2`
  - Factorial: `node src/lib/main.js --factorial 5`
  - Square Root: `node src/lib/main.js --sqrt 16`
