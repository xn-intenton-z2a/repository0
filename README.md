# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file drives the CLI tool and is updated by the workflows to deliver the repository’s capabilities.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file lists all dependencies and scripts used for testing, building, formatting, and linting.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder (e.g., `tests/unit/main.test.js`) ensure that the CLI tool behaves as expected.

- **Documentation:**  
  This `README.md` provides an overview of the project and its capabilities. For detailed contribution guidelines, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run tests with `npm test`.
4. Launch the CLI tool with `npm run start` or view help using `node src/lib/main.js --help`.
5. Run diagnostics with `npm run diagnostics` which outputs: "Diagnostics: All systems operational.".
6. Check the version with `npm run version`.
7. Display a greeting using `node src/lib/main.js --greet`.
8. Compute a sum by running, for example, `node src/lib/main.js --sum 3 4 5` which outputs: "Sum: 12".

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable autonomous, self-evolving code in your repository. By integrating these workflows, the repository stays up-to-date with automated testing, formatting, and dependency management.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
