# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and clear CLI interactions. The code is maintained to align with our mission of clarity, maintainability, and robust demonstration of extended operations including the new prime number check.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` to perform automated CI/CD tasks.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file embodies our mission by providing clear arithmetic and extended operations with enhanced error handling and process automation.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies and scripts for building, testing, and deployment.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that CLI commands and internal functions remain robust and aligned with our project goals. Recent updates have increased test coverage to near 100% by adding direct function invocation tests and deeper mocks on external dependencies.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` provides essential information about the repository, usage, and contribution guidelines.

## Change Log
- Updated header in `src/lib/main.js` to enforce the mission statement and remove drift from earlier versions.
- Enhanced error handling, input validations, and extended operations including the new prime number check.
- Increased unit test coverage by adding additional tests and deeper mocks.
- README refreshed to align with the current contributing guidelines.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts. However, you must supply the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable the repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve the code.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This system is still in development and may not suit production use.
