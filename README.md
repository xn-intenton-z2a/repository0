# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file implements core arithmetic operations including sum, multiplication, subtraction, division, modulo, average, chained exponentiation (power), factorial, and square root.
  
  **New Features:**
  - Added a demo mode that outputs sample data without any network call using the `--demo` flag.
  - Introduced a placeholder flag `--real` which hints at a real API call that is not implemented over the wire.
  - Enhanced error handling and updated inline documentation for improved test coverage.
  - Applied linting and formatting fixes for improved code quality.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` defines dependencies and scripts for build, test, and workflow operations.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script behaves as expected. Recent updates have increased test coverage to approach 100%, covering various arithmetic operations, edge cases, and CLI flag scenarios.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` is maintained to reflect current functionality and planned improvements.

## Changelog
- Updated header comments in `src/lib/main.js` to align with the mission statement and enhance error handling.
- Added demo mode (`--demo`) output and a placeholder for a real API call mode (`--real`).
- Refreshed documentation examples to match current CLI functionality.
- Enhanced unit testing to reach nearly 100% coverage by ensuring all code paths are exercised.
- Applied linting and formatting fixes for improved code quality.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
