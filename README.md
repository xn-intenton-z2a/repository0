# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is integral to the CLI demonstration and is updated automatically by workflows for consistency.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies and defines scripts for building, testing, and running the application.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script operates as expected.

- **Docs:**  
  Documentation is maintained to reflect current functionality and future enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run tests with `npm test` to verify functionality.
4. Start the CLI tool with `npm run start` or view help with `node src/lib/main.js --help`.
5. For diagnostics, run `npm run diagnostics`.
6. To check the current version, run `npm run version` (or `node src/lib/main.js --version`).

## Changelog

- Improved consistency between the source and test files.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
