# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` enabling automated tests, builds, formatting, and issue management.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality resides in `src/lib/main.js`. This CLI tool supports various commands including:
    - `--help` for usage instructions
    - `--version` to display the current version
    - `--diagnostics` to check system health
    - `--greet` to display a greeting message
    - `--sum` to compute the sum of provided numbers
    - `--multiply` to calculate the product of numbers
    - `--subtract` to subtract subsequent numbers from the first

- **Default Behavior:**
  When no arguments are provided, the tool displays a usage message and a demo output indicating no arguments were passed.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure consistency of behavior as implemented in the main script.

- **Dependencies:**
  The `package.json` file lists all dependencies required for running, testing, and maintaining the project. It also contains scripts for build, formatting, linting, and testing.

## Future Features

- **Interactive Mode:** An interactive CLI mode is planned to improve user experience.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Future updates will include more detailed system diagnostics and error reporting.
- **Extended Math Operations:** Additional mathematical functions and validations may be introduced.
- **External API Integrations:** Expansion to include external data validations and interfacing with other APIs.

## Getting Started

This repository comes pre-configured with the necessary workflows. To run the CLI demo, execute:
```bash
npm run start [--help]
```

Supply the following secret in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` (required for automated workflows, e.g. for publishing and diagnostics).

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a suite of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. These workflows are designed to be composed like an SDK and are continuously updated through automated processes.

*Warning:* Running these workflows may incur API costs and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is in development and may not be ready for production use.
