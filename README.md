# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file implements a CLI with operations including greeting, sum, multiplication, subtraction, division, and modulo calculations. When no arguments are provided, the CLI prints a usage message along with a demo output and terminates gracefully.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` defines dependencies and scripts for building, testing, and running the application.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure robust behavior of the CLI, covering edge cases including non-numeric inputs and scenarios where no valid numbers are provided.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` is maintained to reflect current functionality and guide contributions.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
