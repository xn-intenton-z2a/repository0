# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` to perform automated CI/CD tasks.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the repository and is maintained to align with the repository0 mission of clarity and robust demonstration. Recent updates have pruned drift and applied a cohesive mission statement.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies and scripts for building, testing, and deployment. It is updated automatically by workflows as needed.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the CLI commands and internal functions remain robust and aligned with project goals. Recent enhancements have increased test coverage to nearly 100%, including additional edge case tests for Fibonacci and other operations.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` provides essential information about the repository, its usage, and contribution guidelines.

## Change Log
- Updated header documentation in `src/lib/main.js` to apply the mission statement and remove drift.
- Enhanced error handling and input validations across arithmetic and extended operations.
- Added additional edge case tests (e.g., Fibonacci for 0 and 1) to improve overall test coverage.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, allowing them to be composed like an SDK. This project is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
