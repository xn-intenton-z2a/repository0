# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflows and demonstrates various CLI operations including diagnostics, arithmetic operations, and help/version output.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` specifies dependencies, and it also defines test and build scripts which may be updated by workflows.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main functionality remains consistent. The test file `tests/unit/main.test.js` is maintained and updated as needed.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` is kept up-to-date to reflect current functionality and future enhancements.

## Getting Started

This repository is set up with the necessary workflows and scripts. You must supply the following secret in your repository settings:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that allow your repository to operate in an "agentic" manner. Autonomous workflows use branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event and can be composed like an SDK.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still under development and may not suit production use.

## Should you use the `agentic‑lib` Coding System?

* Do you have access to an OpenAI account with necessary API keys?
* Are you willing to incur charges for consumed resources?
* Are you curious about self-evolving code?
* Would you like to see how such a system can be built?
* Do you appreciate integrated OpenAI and GitHub API calls in a JavaScript environment?
