# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file can be modified by the workflow to add or update dependencies and it also defines some of the test and build scripts.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script remains robust. The tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` have been updated to achieve nearly 100% test coverage of all CLI commands and operations.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` is maintained to provide essential information about the repository, usage, and contribution guidelines.

## Change Log
- Pruned drift from previous implementations to strictly adhere to the mission statement.
- Enhanced error handling and input validations in CLI operations.
- Expanded and refined test coverage across all CLI operations to ensure near 100% coverage.
- Updated documentation to reflect all current functionalities.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts, but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.

Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.

## Should you use the `agentic‑lib` Coding System?

* Do you have access to an OpenAI account with necessary API keys?
* Are you willing to incur charges for consumed resources?
* Are you curious about self-evolving code?
* Would you like to see how such a system can be built?
* Do you appreciate integrated OpenAI and GitHub API calls in a JavaScript environment?
