# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Automated workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory leverage reusable actions from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`. In addition to logging the provided arguments and displaying usage instructions, the script now also supports a new flag:
  
  - `--version`: Displays the current version of the application as defined in `package.json`.

- **Dependencies:**  
  Managed via `package.json`, which defines core packages and scripts to maintain consistency in build and test routines.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the script outputs the expected log messages. The tests now also validate the new `--version` flag functionality.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` details project setup, usage, and outlines a roadmap for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the tests with `npm test` to verify functionality.
4. Start the CLI tool with `npm run start` or use `node src/lib/main.js --help` for assistance.
5. For diagnostics, run `npm run diagnostics`.
6. To check the current version, run `npm run version` (or `node src/lib/main.js --version`).

## Changelog

- Extended the functionality in the main CLI to support a new `--version` flag that displays the package version.
