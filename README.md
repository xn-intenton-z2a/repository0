# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows. The main functionality now logs the command-line arguments and, when run without interactive input, terminates immediately after displaying a demo output or usage instructions.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**
  Automated workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory leverage reusable actions from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**
  The main functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`. At this stage, it provides a basic demonstration by displaying the passed arguments and usage instructions when `--help` is invoked. The script now ensures that it terminates execution immediately after running, without waiting for further user input.

- **Dependencies:**
  Managed via `package.json`, which defines core packages and scripts to maintain consistency in build and test routines.

- **Tests:**
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the script outputs the expected log messages. The tests now confirm that default execution and help commands behave as expected.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` details project setup, usage, and outlines a roadmap for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the tests with `npm test` to verify functionality.
4. Start the CLI tool with `npm run start` or use `node src/lib/main.js --help` for assistance.
5. For diagnostics, run `npm run diagnostics`.

## Changelog

- Updated main function to ensure proper termination after displaying usage and demo output, even when run non-interactively.
