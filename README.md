# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file implements core arithmetic operations including sum, multiplication, subtraction, division, modulo, average, chained exponentiation (power), factorial, and square root, with enhanced error handling. The file has been pruned to remove drift and align fully with repository0's mission.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` defines dependencies and scripts for build, test, and workflow operations.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script behaves as expected, with comprehensive coverage for arithmetic operations and edge cases.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` is maintained to reflect current functionality and planned improvements.

## Changelog
- Updated header comments in `src/lib/main.js` to align with repository0's mission and remove drift from previous implementation details.
- Verified and updated documentation examples in this README to cover arithmetic operations including chained exponentiation, factorial, and square root.
- Enhanced error handling for version retrieval and arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

### Usage Examples

Run the CLI application with different flags:
- Display help: `node src/lib/main.js --help`
- Get version: `node src/lib/main.js --version`
- Run diagnostics: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`
- Arithmetic operations examples:
  - Sum: `node src/lib/main.js --sum 1 2 3`
  - Multiply: `node src/lib/main.js --multiply 2 3 4`
  - Power (chained exponentiation): `node src/lib/main.js --power 2 3 2`
  - Factorial: `node src/lib/main.js --factorial 5`
  - Square Root: `node src/lib/main.js --sqrt 16`
