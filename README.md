# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation demonstrating one way to use the template.
* Automated Workflows: GitHub workflows imported from `agentic‑lib` that provide CI/CD automation.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository showcasing GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate automated CI/CD processes and serve as a reliable starting point for new projects.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Located in `.github/workflows/`, these workflows use reusable components from `agentic‑lib` to streamline operations.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is central to the workflows and project goals.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file specifies scripts and dependencies needed for building, testing, and running the project.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the core functionality remains intact. These tests guide future enhancements and bug fixes.

- **Documentation:**  
  This `README.md` serves as an evolving guide to the project, reflecting current features and future plans.

## Getting Started

The repository is pre-configured with necessary scripts and workflows. Before running, ensure you have set the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` – required for GitHub workflows involving OpenAI chat completions.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** provides reusable GitHub Actions workflows designed to empower your repository with automated code evolution and CI/CD functionalities. These workflows enable continuous integration, issue management, and code improvements.

*Warning:* Running these workflows may incur costs on your OpenAI account and utilize GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This system is under active development and may not be suitable for production.

## Should you use the `agentic‑lib` Coding System?

* Do you have access to an OpenAI account with required API keys?
* Are you ready to incur resource consumption costs?
* Are you curious about or supportive of automated, self-evolving codebases?
* Do you value integrated OpenAI and GitHub API capabilities in JavaScript?
