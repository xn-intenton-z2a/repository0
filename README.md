# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file handles CLI arguments including:
    - `--help`: Shows usage instructions.
    - `--version`: Displays the current version.
    - `--diagnostics`: Runs a diagnostic check.
    - `--greet`: Outputs a greeting message.
    - **`--sum`: Computes the sum of provided numeric arguments.**
  
- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies, defines scripts for building, testing, and running the application, and ensures compatibility with Node 20.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests within `tests/unit/` ensure that the CLI behaves as expected across different flags and input types.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` explains the current behavior. Future updates may include additional functionalities such as enhanced command suggestions, extended diagnostics, and more interactive CLI features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run tests with `npm test`.
4. Launch the CLI tool with `npm run start` or view help using `node src/lib/main.js --help`.
5. Run diagnostics with `npm run diagnostics` which outputs: "Diagnostics: All systems operational.".
6. Check the version with `npm run version`.
7. Display a greeting using `node src/lib/main.js --greet`.
8. Compute a sum by running, for example, `node src/lib/main.js --sum 3 4 5` which outputs: "Sum: 12".

## Future Roadmap

- Integration of intelligent command suggestions based on user input.
- Extended diagnostics and self-healing features.
- More comprehensive test coverage and additional CLI functionality enhancements.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
