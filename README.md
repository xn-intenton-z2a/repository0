# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is updated to ensure robust CLI operations and enhanced error handling. Recently, an exponentiation feature (--power) has been added to extend the arithmetic operations inline with our mission.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` can be modified by the workflow to add or update dependencies and defines scripts for testing, building, and formatting.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script remains reliable. The test file has been updated to reflect enhanced error handling, near 100% test coverage, and new arithmetic functionalities.

- **Docs**  
  This `README.md` is maintained with updates that reflect changes in functionality and upcoming features.

## Change Log
- Mission Statement Reviewed: Streamlined the CLI demonstration to focus on core arithmetic, error handling, and CLI interactivity.
- Test Coverage Enhanced: Improved tests to nearly 100% coverage, including error handling and robust flag processing.
- New Exponentiation Feature: Added a '--power' flag to compute chained exponentiation of numbers.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
