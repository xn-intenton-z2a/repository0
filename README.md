# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**
  Automated workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory leverage reusable actions from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**
  The main functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflows and is iteratively improved to meet project goals.

- **Dependencies:**
  Managed via `package.json`, which defines core packages and scripts, ensuring consistency with both build and test routines.

- **Tests:**
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder validate that the main script functions correctly and adheres to expected outputs.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` details project setup, usage, and a roadmap for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the tests with `npm test` to verify functionality.
4. Start the CLI tool with `npm run start` or use `node src/lib/main.js --help` for assistance.
5. For diagnostics, run `npm run diagnostics`.

## 20-Step Roadmap to Deliver the Mission

To evolve the repository from its current experimental state to a fully realized project aligned with our mission, consider the following step-by-step plan:

1. Audit the current codebase and document existing functionalities.
2. Enhance the CLI by introducing more comprehensive command-line options and help commands.
3. Refine the main function to handle various input scenarios gracefully.
4. Integrate default argument behavior to avoid unexpected outputs.
5. Improve error handling and provide diagnostic messages for troubleshooting.
6. Expand unit tests to cover edge cases and additional scenarios.
7. Align the source code with modern ECMAScript standards and best practices.
8. Update the build scripts to automate further testing and integration checks.
9. Update documentation and README to accurately reflect current features and planned enhancements.
10. Incorporate continuous integration workflows to streamline automated testing.
11. Introduce code linting and formatting steps to maintain standardized code quality.
12. Engage community feedback through open issues and pull requests.
13. Iterate on the contribution guidelines to incorporate lessons learned.
14. Enhance dependency management strategies with automated update scripts.
15. Ensure robust integration with GitHub Actions for automated deployment and diagnostics.
16. Develop additional diagnostic tools to monitor performance and usage.
17. Implement logging enhancements to maintain detailed execution records.
18. Prepare detailed release notes and migration guides for each new version.
19. Pilot new features in a controlled environment before full deployment.
20. Establish an ongoing review process to continuously refine and update the system based on feedback and technological advancements.
