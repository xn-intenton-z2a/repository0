# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` to perform automated CI/CD tasks.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the cornerstone of the CLI tool and is maintained to align with the mission of clarity and robust functionality.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file manages dependencies, scripts for build, test, and deployment, and is updated by automated workflows when needed.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder verify that the CLI commands and internal functions perform as expected, ensuring that the code remains robust and testable.

- **Docs:**  
  This `README.md` provides essential information about the repository, its usage, and the contribution guidelines.

## Change Log
- Refreshed README to align with CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
- Updated documentation to prune irrelevant content and highlight current project goals.
- No changes to source code functionality.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts. You need to supply the following secret for running workflows:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`. Set this secret in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and the workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.
