# repository0

Is this all just generated by AI? - Yes, a lot is but please stick with it because the intention here is to see just how far we can take a self improving agentic coding system.

## Overview
repository0 is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon agentic‑lib. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows. One example seed idea included here is the Equation Plotter—a simple SVG-based tool that plots mathematical functions (quadratic and sine). This seed idea is one of many possible projects you can create by changing the seed directive.

## What’s Inside
- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file implements the Equation Plotter, which generates and logs plots for a quadratic function (y = x²) and a sine function (y = sin(x)).

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script runs correctly and that module imports work as expected.

- **Scripts:**  
  The `scripts/` folder contains Bash scripts to export source files, clear local history, update dependencies, and clean the project.

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory automate testing, publishing, dependency updates, formatting, and issue management. These workflows pull from intentïon agentic‑lib and use specific repository variables.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run repository0:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Run in your terminal:  
   `git clone <repository_url>`

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Change into the project directory and run:  
   `npm install`

3. **Run the Demo:**  
   Execute the main script with:  
   `node src/lib/main.js`  
   This will display the plots for the quadratic and sine functions.

4. **Run Tests:**  
   To verify that everything is working, run:  
   `npm test`

## Repository Variables and Secrets
The GitHub workflows in this repository use the following variables. Make sure they are set in your repository settings under Variables or Secrets:

- **BUILD_SCRIPT:** `npm run build`
- **TEST_SCRIPT:** `npm test`
- **MAIN_SCRIPT:** `node src/lib/main.js`
- **npmAuthOrganisation:** `@xn-intenton-z2a`
- **gitUserEmail:** `action@github.com`
- **gitUserName:** `GitHub Actions[bot]`

Additionally, the following secrets are required by the workflows:

- **CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY**
- **PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**

Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## Other Seed Ideas
The Equation Plotter is provided as an example seed idea. repository0 is designed so that you can easily create other projects. By cloning or using this repository as a template, you can start projects for different types of data visualization tools or other agentic libraries. Simply change the seed directive and update the repository variables to match your new project.

## Future Improvements
- Extend support for 3D equation plotting.
- Introduce animation for dynamic data visualization.
- Provide an API for transforming and customizing user-defined functions.
- Offer a canvas fallback option for environments without SVG support.
- Optimize performance for plotting large datasets.

## Final Notes
repository0 demonstrates a working example of integrating intentïon agentic‑lib workflows. It is clear and adaptable—ready for you to explore and modify for your own projects!
