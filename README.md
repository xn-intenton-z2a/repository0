# `repository0`

This repository serves as a template demonstrating automated CI/CD workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib` and includes a basic CLI built with Node.js.

You probably want to start with the template documentation here: [TEMPLATE-README.md](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/blob/main/TEMPLATE-README.md)

## Overview

`repository0` is a demo repository showcasing GitHub workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` along with a simple CLI tool. The CLI functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js` and provides the following commands:

- **version**: Prints the current version.
- **diagnostics**: Displays diagnostic information including the Node.js version.
- **help**: Shows a help message with usage instructions.

This repository demonstrates how automated workflows can manage source code, tests, and documentation.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory use reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` to automate project tasks.

- **Source Code:**  
  The core CLI is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`. It handles CLI commands and is consistently maintained alongside the project’s tests.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file defines project dependencies and scripts for testing, formatting, linting, and running the CLI.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder verify the functionality of the CLI commands (`version`, `diagnostics`, and `help`).

- **Documentation:**  
  This README provides an overview of the repository. Detailed CLI usage instructions are available in [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Getting Started

The repository is pre-configured with necessary workflows and scripts. To run the CLI locally, ensure you set the required secret:

- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` – A key for account access to the OpenAI chat completions API (model `o3-mini`).

Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

Run the CLI with the following npm script:

```bash
npm run start
```
