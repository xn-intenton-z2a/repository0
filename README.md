# repository0

Is this all just generated by AI? - Yes, a lot is but please stick with it because the intentïon here is to see just how far we can take a self improving agentic coding system.

## Overview
repository0 is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon agentic‑lib. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows. One example seed idea included here is the Equation Plotter—a simple SVG-based tool that plots mathematical functions (quadratic and sine). This seed idea is one of many possible projects you can create by changing the seed directive.

## What’s Inside
- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file implements the Equation Plotter, which generates and logs plots for a quadratic function (y = x²) and a sine function (y = sin(x)).

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script runs correctly and that module imports work as expected.

- **Scripts:**  
  The `scripts/` folder contains Bash scripts to export source files, clear local history, update dependencies, and clean the project.

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory automate testing, publishing, dependency updates, formatting, and issue management. These workflows pull from intentïon agentic‑lib and use specific repository variables.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run repository0:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Run in your terminal:  
   `git clone <repository_url>`

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Change into the project directory and run:  
   `npm install`

3. **Run the Demo:**  
   Execute the main script with:  
   `node src/lib/main.js`  
   This will display the plots for the quadratic and sine functions.

4. **Run Tests:**  
   To verify that everything is working, run:  
   `npm test`

## Repository Variables and Secrets

The following secrets are required by the workflows:

- **CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY**
- **PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**

Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## Other Seed Ideas
The Equation Plotter is provided as an example seed idea. repository0 is designed so that you can easily create other projects. By cloning or using this repository as a template, you can start projects for different types of data visualization tools or other agentic libraries. Simply change the seed directive and update the repository variables to match your new project.

## Future Improvements
- Extend support for 3D equation plotting.
- Introduce animation for dynamic data visualization.
- Provide an API for transforming and customizing user-defined functions.
- Offer a canvas fallback option for environments without SVG support.
- Optimize performance for plotting large datasets.

## Diary of an agentic coding system - Day 1

In the early hours, repository0 burst into existence with a bold declaration: an Equation Plotter Library that transformed simple mathematical functions into vivid SVG art. The very first strokes on the canvas showcased the elegance of quadratic curves and the rhythmic flow of sine waves—a promise of what was to come.

Almost immediately, the code’s story took a literary turn. A series of impassioned revisions reimagined the header comment block—evolving it into a refreshed, README-style narrative. Each update sought to capture the essence of the project, meticulously detailing features like interactive zooming, custom styling, and the export of elegant SVG files. This poetic reinvention underscored a deep commitment to clarity and vision.

Then came a daring expansion. A new chapter was written when polar plot functionality emerged—a feature that redefined boundaries by converting polar coordinates into stunning Cartesian displays. The SVG output itself grew, expanding in height to make room for this new visual symphony. The addition of the polar plot was a moment of triumph, heralding a leap into unexplored dimensions.

Yet, the journey was not linear. As the repository matured, the narrative shifted once more. The demo run, once content with console outputs, was transformed to generate a tangible SVG file—a clear, striking emblem of the project’s potential. Alongside these innovations, there was a continuous cycle of refining code formatting and documentation, ensuring that every line of code echoed the clarity of its ambition.

In a final act to secure its legacy, repository0 embraced stability by adding a package-lock file. This strategic move locked in dependencies and promised reproducible builds, cementing the project’s foundation for the future.

**Summary:**  
repository0’s evolution is marked by distinct arcs of initiative. It began with the core plotting of quadratic and sine functions, then shifted into a series of documentation and formatting enhancements. The dramatic introduction of polar plotting expanded its visual vocabulary, while changes in demo output transformed user interaction. Throughout, iterative revisions—sometimes even undoing earlier stylistic choices—revealed a dynamic, evolving vision striving for clarity and excellence.

## Final Notes
repository0 demonstrates a working example of integrating intentïon agentic‑lib workflows. It is clear and adaptable—ready for you to explore and modify for your own projects!
