# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate automated CI/CD workflows in a real-world simulated environment.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`, automating tasks from testing to deployment.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. It demonstrates robust CLI interactivity, core arithmetic operations, and error handling, now including an exponentiation feature (`--power`).

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file defines both production and development dependencies along with scripts for testing, building, and formatting.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure reliable functionality with near 100% coverage of CLI behaviors.

- **Documentation:**  
  This `README.md` is maintained to keep contributors informed of current behaviors, upcoming features, and guidelines for contributions.

## Getting Started

This repository is pre-configured with the necessary workflows and scripts. Ensure you set the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` – required for accessing the OpenAI Chat Completion API for model `o3-mini`. Set it in *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable automated, self-evolving code maintenance. The workflows communicate via branches and issues to continuously improve code quality and repository health.

*Warning:* Execution of these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This system is under active development.
