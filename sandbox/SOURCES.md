# Node.js FS Promises API

## https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api
The Node.js fs/promises API offers a modern, promise-based interface for file system operations, including `readFile`, `writeFile`, `readdir`, and more. It eliminates callback complexity, supports async/await patterns, and provides guidance on error handling and performance considerations. This is foundational for implementing all file I/O commands in the CLI, such as reading `MISSION.md` and `package.json`.
