# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
The CLI_PARSER feature enhances the main script to process command-line arguments more intelligently. When invoked, the updated main script checks for a '--help' flag and displays usage information. If the '--help' flag is not present, the script will continue with its default behavior by printing the received arguments in a structured format.

## Implementation Details
1. Update the source file (src/lib/main.js):
   - Parse the command-line arguments using process.argv.
   - If the '--help' argument is detected, output a help message describing the available usage options and exit.
   - Otherwise, print the formatted arguments to the console as before.

2. Update the test files (tests/unit/main.test.js):
   - Add test cases to verify that the help message is shown when '--help' is passed as an argument.
   - Confirm that normal invocation without '--help' continues to produce the default output.

3. Update the README.md:
   - Document the new CLI behavior, including details on how users can view help information by running 'npm run start -- --help'.

4. Update the package.json if needed:
   - Ensure that the main script, test scripts, and any relevant documentation reflect the inclusion of this CLI processing logic.

## Expected Impact
The CLI_PARSER feature improves user interaction by clearly communicating how to use the tool via command-line options. It provides immediate help and usage instructions directly from the command line, aligning with the repository's mission to demonstrate automated workflows and effective CLI-based interactions.

## Testing and Validation
- Run the command without '--help' to check regular output behavior.
- Run the command with '--help' and verify that a proper help message is displayed and that the process exits gracefully.
- Ensure unit tests pass for the new functionality using the vitest framework.
