# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the command line interface by adding basic argument parsing capabilities to the main script. The updated functionality detects common flags such as --help to improve user guidance and overall experience when running the tool.

## Source Code Modifications
- Update the main script in src/lib/main.js to check for the --help flag among the command line arguments.
- If --help is present, output a concise usage message including available options and exit without performing other actions.
- Retain the original behavior for regular arguments by printing the provided arguments in JSON format.

## Test Enhancements
- Modify tests/unit/main.test.js to include a test scenario where the --help flag is provided. Verify that the usage message is printed and that the process terminates without error.
- Keep existing tests intact to ensure backward compatibility and to validate the new functionality in isolation.

## Documentation Updates
- Update the README.md file to document the new CLI parsing capabilities. Include a section that explains and demonstrates the usage of the --help flag.

## Dependency Considerations
- No external dependencies are required for this feature. The built-in JavaScript capabilities are sufficient to implement the functionality.
