# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the Node.js CLI utility by introducing a command-line parser. The parser will recognize commands such as help, version, and echo. This enhancement aims to provide a better user experience by clearly guiding users through available commands and expected inputs. It is designed in accordance with the project mission to deliver handy CLI utilities and remains within the constraints of modifying only the source file, test file, README file and dependencies file.

## Command Details
- The CLI parser inspects the arguments passed to the main function.
- The command 'help' will display usage instructions directly in the console.
- The command 'version' will output the current version as specified in package.json.
- The command 'echo' will repeat the additional arguments for demonstration.
- By default, if no known command is provided, the CLI will print a concise description of available commands.

## Source and Test Updates
- In the source file (src/lib/main.js), the parser logic is added. It conditionally processes commands and prints relevant output.
- Updates in the test file (tests/unit/main.test.js) include tests for the new commands. Tests ensure that help and version commands produce the expected output and that echo repeats the subsequent arguments.

## Documentation and Dependencies
- The README file is updated to include usage examples for invoking the CLI with the new commands. This ensures that users have clear instructions on how to utilize the CLI parser.
- The package.json file is updated with relevant script descriptions if needed. No new dependencies are added to maintain simplicity and focus on core functionality.

## Impact
This feature directly enhances the product's core functionality by providing standard command parsing capabilities in a CLI application. It reinforces the mission of delivering useful utilities and improves usability for end users.
