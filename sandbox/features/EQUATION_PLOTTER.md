# EQUATION_PLOTTER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature extends the functionality of the repository by allowing the user to generate simple visual representations of mathematical functions. When the tool is invoked with the "--plot" argument, it will display basic plots for quadratic and sine functions in the console. This directly supports the demonstration of multiple workflows as described in the README and aligns with the repository mission to showcase automated and interactive CLI-based behaviors.

## Implementation Details
1. Update src/lib/main.js:
   - Check the received arguments for the "--plot" flag.
   - If detected, instead of just printing the command-line arguments, call a new function that prints a textual representation of the quadratic function plot and the sine function plot.
   - If "--help" is provided, display the help message as implemented by the CLI_PARSER feature.
   - Otherwise, maintain the default behavior.

2. Update tests/unit/main.test.js:
   - Add test cases to simulate the scenario where "--plot" is passed. Use assertions to verify that the output contains expected substrings (e.g. "Quadratic Plot:" and "Sine Plot:").
   - Ensure that the tests cover both the help and non-help pathways.

3. Update README.md:
   - Document the new "--plot" flag and include instructions on how to run the tool in the plotting mode (e.g. "npm run start -- --plot").
   - Provide a brief explanation of the displayed plots and their significance.

4. (Optional) Modify package.json if additional dependencies are required. In this implementation, no external libraries are added, ensuring minimal impact on existing dependencies.

## Expected Impact
This feature significantly enhances the repository by adding a core functionality that demonstrates dynamic behavior. Rather than only processing CLI arguments, users can now interact with the tool to view outputs that mimic equation plots. This supports the repository's mission of showcasing automated and interactive workflows while ensuring that changes remain confined to a single file and its associated tests and documentation.
