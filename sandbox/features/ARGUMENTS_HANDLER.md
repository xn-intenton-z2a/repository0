# ARGUMENTS_HANDLER FEATURE SPEC

## Overview
This feature introduces a basic command-line argument handler to enhance the primary CLI functionality. The handler checks for common flags such as --help and --version, and prints out appropriate messages. This addresses the need for clear usage instructions and version information directly via the CLI.

## Implementation
- Update src/lib/main.js to inspect the arguments provided at runtime.
- If the argument '--help' is passed, display a usage message outlining the available commands and examples.
- If the argument '--version' is passed, read and display the version from package.json.
- For any other arguments, default to the current behavior (printing the received arguments as JSON).

## Testing
- Modify tests/unit/main.test.js to include tests for --help and --version flags, ensuring that the respective outputs are correct.
- Ensure that the default behavior (no special flags) continues to work as expected.

## Documentation
- Update README.md to include a section on CLI usage that mentions the new flags.
- Clarify the expectation for --help to print usage details and --version to print the repository version.

## Dependencies
- Use only the existing libraries. No new third-party libraries are required as the feature logic is straightforward.

This feature enhances core CLI functionality and aligns with the repository's mission to showcase dynamic workflow capabilities and transparent operations.
