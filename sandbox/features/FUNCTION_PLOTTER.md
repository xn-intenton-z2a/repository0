# FUNCTION_PLOTTER

## Overview
This feature extends the CLI functionality of the repository by adding a plotter mode for basic mathematical functions. When activated, the tool computes values for quadratic and sine functions and outputs them as a simple textual table. This directly enhances the repository's core demonstration of agentic workflows and interactive experiences.

## Functionality
- The main CLI script (src/lib/main.js) will be updated to check for the argument "plot". If present, the script moves into plotter mode.
- In plotter mode, the script iterates over a range of x values, computes a quadratic value (for example, x squared) and the sine value for each x, then prints the results in a clear, user-friendly format.
- Tests in tests/unit/main.test.js will be extended to verify that running the script with the plot argument completes without error and produces expected output.
- The README file will be updated to include instructions on how to use the new plotter mode, explaining how to run "npm run start plot" to see the mathematical outputs.
- The package.json dependencies and scripts remain aligned with the core purpose of this repository, ensuring that no additional files are added beyond the allowed modifications.

## Implementation Considerations
- The change is limited to the existing source file, test file, README, and dependencies file if needed.
- The feature is designed to add meaningful interactive functionality without over-complicating the codebase.
- It aligns with the mission of showcasing automated workflows and generating demonstrable outputs via a simple CLI tool.

## Outcome
Users can now actively see the results of quadratic and sine calculations, reinforcing the repository's demonstration of dynamic capabilities. This feature provides measurable value by enhancing interactive user experience while following the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.
