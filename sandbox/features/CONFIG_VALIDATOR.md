# CONFIG_VALIDATOR Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the repository by adding configuration validation to the CLI tool. In addition to parsing key=value pairs, the main function will now validate certain configuration parameters using a schema defined with zod. This provides an extra layer of reliability and prevents runtime issues caused by unexpected input types. The feature directly supports the mission of reliable automated workflows by ensuring the configuration is correctly formed before processing.

## Implementation
The main file in src/lib/main.js will be updated to include a configuration schema using zod. The existing key=value parser will be extended as follows:

1. Load key=value arguments from process.argv.
2. Merge these with any default configurations.
3. Define a zod schema to validate expected configuration keys such as debug (boolean), port (number), and output (string).
4. Parse the merged configuration object using the zod schema and handle any validation errors gracefully.
5. Log either the validated configuration or a helpful error message.

The test file tests/unit/main.test.js will be updated to simulate calling main with both valid and invalid configurations. Unit tests will include cases such as:
- A valid configuration where debug is "true" or "false", port is a valid number, and output is a non-empty string.
- An invalid configuration that should trigger an error and a corresponding log message.

## Documentation
The README.md file will be updated to document the new configuration validation capability. It will include instructions on how to supply configuration parameters via the command-line (for example, debug=true, port=3000, output=json) and explain how the configuration is validated at runtime.

## Testing
Unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js will be added for both valid and erroneous configuration inputs. The tests will ensure that:
- When provided with correct types, the configuration is accepted and logged correctly.
- When the configuration does not conform to the schema, proper error messages are emitted.

This feature builds on the current ARG_PARSER functionality, directly enhancing the repository's primary capability by ensuring only valid configurations proceed to execution, in line with the repository mission of robust workflow demonstrations.
