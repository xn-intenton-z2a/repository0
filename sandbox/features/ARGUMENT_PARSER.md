# ARGUMENT_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces enhancement to the command-line interface by adding argument parsing capabilities. The primary goal is to process common CLI flags such as --help, thereby providing clear guidance to users on how to run the application. This update extends the main functionality of the repository by enabling more interactive and descriptive command line interactions.

## Implementation Details
- Update the src/lib/main.js file to include logic for processing command line arguments, particularly support for a --help flag. When a user runs the program with the --help flag, it should display a usage message explaining how to execute the command and describing available options.
- The main function will examine the provided arguments list. If it detects the --help flag, it will print a usage message and exit gracefully.
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing functionality by ensuring that if no flags are provided, the original behavior of logging the arguments remains intact.

## Testing Strategy
- Modify tests/unit/main.test.js to include a test case that simulates running the program with the --help argument. The test should ensure that the correct usage message appears in the output and that the process terminates without error.

## Documentation
- Update README.md to include a new section outlining the use of the --help flag. This section will explain how to run the tool and what the expected output looks like when using the new argument parsing functionality.

## Dependencies and Compatibility
- No additional dependencies are required as the argument parsing will be implemented using built-in JavaScript features.
- Ensure that the feature aligns with the project requirements and mission as stated in MISSION.md and follows the guidelines outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.
