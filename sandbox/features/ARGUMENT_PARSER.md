# ARGUMENT_PARSER Feature Specification

This feature enhances the command line interface in the main source file by providing improved argument parsing. It adds support for basic flags and commands such as --help and --version. The functionality will offer users clear usage instructions and version information, ensuring a more informative and user-friendly CLI experience.

## Overview

The ARGUMENT_PARSER feature will extend the main function to interpret and act on common CLI flags. On invocation with --help, the script will output a help message detailing available commands. When called with --version, it will print the current version as specified in the package.json file. Other command line arguments will be passed through to maintain existing functionality.

## Implementation Details

- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) to include a simple argument parser that checks for the flags --help and --version.
- When the flag --help is provided, the program outputs usage instructions along with a brief description of the available flags.
- When the flag --version is provided, the program reads the version from package.json and outputs it.
- Maintain the default behavior of logging the passed arguments if no recognized flags are provided.

## Testing

- Update the unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to simulate different command line flags and verify the output. For example, a test confirming that the help message displays correctly with the --help flag and another verifying that the version is correctly output with the --version flag.
- Ensure that the existing functionality is preserved when no flags are provided.

## Documentation

- Update the README.md file to include details on the new CLI flags, usage examples, and a brief explanation of how to invoke the help and version commands.
- Ensure that the feature aligns with the mission statement and is easy for contributors to understand and extend if needed.

This feature delivers substantial user impact by adding clarity to the CLI usage of the repository, thereby enhancing the overall user experience while maintaining the repository's original intent as a demonstration of GitHub workflow capabilities.
