# VERBOSE_LOGGING Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a new command line flag --verbose to the main script. When the user provides this flag, the application will output additional debugging information such as a timestamp and environment details. This feature enhances the core functionality by providing more context during execution, making it easier to understand the runtime state and diagnose issues.

## Implementation Details
- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) to detect the --verbose flag. When present, log extra details including a current timestamp, Node version, and the processed arguments along with a custom verbose message.
- Modify the existing CLI parsing logic to differentiate between standard and verbose outputs.
- Update the README file to include a new section on CLI usage for the --verbose flag, providing examples of how to run the script with verbose logging.
- Update the dependencies file if any additional minor packages (if needed) are required. Note: This feature should work with existing dependencies, ensuring minimal footprint.

## Testing
- Add a unit test in tests/unit/main.test.js to simulate providing the --verbose flag and check that the output contains additional debugging details like the timestamp and version information.
- Ensure tests cover cases when no flags or only non-verbose flags are provided, verifying that the output remains as expected without verbose output.

## Documentation
- Amend the README to clearly list the new --verbose option under the CLI usage sections.
- Document the feature in any contributor guides or feature listings so that it aligns with the mission to enhance user clarity and functionality.
