# ARG_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the repository's command-line interface by enabling the parsing of key=value arguments. When users run the main script, the application will interpret arguments provided in the format key=value and output them as a JSON object. This addition increases the flexibility and utility of the CLI tool, providing a mechanism for dynamic input handling.

## Implementation
The main function in src/lib/main.js will be updated to identify key=value pairs from process.argv. The implementation will split each argument on the '=' character and aggregate them into a dictionary. If an argument does not follow the key=value format, it will remain as a plain string entry. The resulting output is then logged to the console.

## Testing
The unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js will be updated to include tests that simulate command-line arguments in key=value format. Tests will verify that the parsed output matches expected key/value pairs as well as ensuring that the function still handles cases where arguments do not adhere to the key=value format correctly.

## Documentation
The README.md file will be updated to document the new behavior. Instructions on how to run the CLI with key=value pairs will be included along with examples demonstrating both standard and key/value input usage.

This feature directly impacts the repository's primary functionality by enriching the demo output of npm run start, showcasing enhanced input processing capabilities in line with the repository's mission of demonstrating automated workflows and dynamic behavior.
