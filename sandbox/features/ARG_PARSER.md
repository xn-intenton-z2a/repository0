# ARG_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the repository's CLI capabilities by adding simple argument parsing to the main source file. It enables the tool to process command line flags and options, returning a structured output to facilitate future enhancements and user guidance. The improved behavior focuses on delivering substantial user impact through clearer command interactions.

## Implementation Details
- Modify src/lib/main.js to implement a basic argument parser.
- The parser should recognize flags such as --help and --version. For now, a default response can be output for these cases.
- Update the console output to provide detailed information when a recognized flag is passed. For example, --help should print usage information and --version should print the version number from package.json (read manually from a constant if needed).
- Ensure that any unrecognized flags continue to be handled gracefully with a default message.

## Testing
- Update tests/unit/main.test.js to include test cases that simulate passing the --help and --version flags to the main function. The tests should verify that the correct outputs are printed to the console.
- Ensure existing tests for basic functionality still pass by running the main function without arguments.

## Documentation
- Update README.md to include a section on CLI usage that explains the new options provided by the argument parser.
- Clearly document the behavior of the --help and --version flags, providing examples of how to run the updated command.

This iteration focuses on core functionality improvements that enhance user interaction while remaining consistent with the repository's mission of demonstrating effective and automated workflows.
