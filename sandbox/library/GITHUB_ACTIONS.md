# GITHUB_ACTIONS

## Crawl Summary
Extracted technical content directly from the GitHub Actions documentation. Includes details on defining workflows in YAML, triggering events (push, manual, schedule), job definitions, runner configurations, matrix strategies for testing, caching dependencies, and containerized services. A sample YAML workflow demonstrates practical usage and integration of actions like checkout and environment variable interpolation.

## Normalised Extract
TABLE OF CONTENTS:
1. Workflows
   - Defined in YAML in .github/workflows
   - Must use .yml or .yaml extension
   - Triggered by events (push, pull_request, schedule, manual)
2. Events
   - on: push, fork, label, issues, repository_dispatch
   - Support for activity types and filters
3. Jobs
   - Defined under jobs key; runs-on specifies runner (e.g., ubuntu-latest)
   - Dependencies managed with needs: keyword
   - Matrix strategies for parallel configurations
4. Actions
   - Reusable operations, e.g., actions/checkout@v4
   - Can run scripts or external actions
5. Runners
   - GitHub-hosted: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
   - Self-hosted options available with configured labels
6. Advanced Features
   - Caching using actions/cache with defined keys
   - Container services with services key for ephemeral containers
   - Secure use of secrets for environment variables
   - Dependent jobs using needs; reusing workflows

DETAILS:
Workflows are configured with 'name', 'run-name', and 'on' keys. Jobs specify 'runs-on' and steps that include run commands and uses directives. Example placeholders like ${{ github.event_name }}, ${{ runner.os }}, ${{ github.ref }} allow dynamic configuration.
Example YAML snippet demonstrates cloning repository code, listing workspace contents, and echoing status messages.

## Supplementary Details
CONFIGURATION DETAILS:
- Workflow file location: .github/workflows/*.yml
- YAML keys: name (string), run-name (string), on (array of events), jobs (object mapping job names to configurations)
- Job specification: 'runs-on' (e.g., ubuntu-latest), 'needs' for dependencies, strategy for matrix builds, steps array for sequential execution
- Step types: run (shell commands), uses (actions from marketplace)
- Matrix example: strategy: matrix: { node: [14, 16] } with 'node-version' parameter using ${{ matrix.node }}
- Caching mechanism: actions/cache@v4 with keys constructed using runner.os, environment variables, and hashFiles('**/package-lock.json')
- Service containers: defined under jobs[*].services with image specifications (e.g., postgres) and environment variables for connectivity
- Secrets: injected using ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} for secure operations (e.g., authentication tokens)
- Detailed steps include checking out repository, listing directory contents, and echoing current job status. This configuration provides a base for CI/CD pipelines and can be extended per project requirements.

## Reference Details
API SPECIFICATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1. Workflow YAML Structure:
   - File must be saved under .github/workflows with extension .yml or .yaml.
   - Example fields: 
     name: string
     run-name: string (supports GitHub context variables, e.g., ${{ github.actor }})
     on: [event] where event can be push, pull_request, schedule, etc.
   - Jobs object: each key defines a job with properties:
     runs-on: string (e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest)
     needs: [job names] (optional, for dependencies)
     strategy: matrix: { key: [value, ...] } (optional)
     steps: array of step objects
        Each step can have:
          run: string (shell command) OR
          uses: string (action identifier, e.g. actions/checkout@v4)
          with: object (parameters for the action)
2. Sample Code Example:
   - Checkout repository code:
     Step Object:
       {
         "name": "Check out repository code",
         "uses": "actions/checkout@v4"
       }
   - Running a command and listing files:
     {
       "run": "echo \"Listing files...\""
     },
     {
       "name": "List files",
       "run": "ls ${{ github.workspace }}"
     }
3. Matrix Strategy Example:
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       strategy:
         matrix:
           node: [14, 16]
       steps:
         - name: Setup Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
         - run: npm install
         - run: npm test

4. Caching Dependencies Example:
   - Using actions/cache@v4:
     steps:
       - name: Cache node modules
         uses: actions/cache@v4
         env:
           cache-name: cache-node-modules
         with:
           path: ~/.npm
           key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
           restore-keys: |
             ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-

5. Dependent Jobs Example:
   jobs:
     setup:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: ./setup_server.sh
     build:
       needs: setup
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: ./build_server.sh
     test:
       needs: build
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: ./test_server.sh

6. Best Practices & Troubleshooting:
   - Always verify that workflow files are placed in the correct directory (.github/workflows).
   - Use explicit versions for actions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4) to ensure reproducibility.
   - Check workflow logs via the Actions tab on GitHub; expand steps to see full command outputs.
   - For caching, ensure correct key formation to prevent stale data retrieval.
   - When troubleshooting, use echo commands to output environment values (e.g., echo ${{ github.ref }}) and verify runner configurations.
   - For authentication issues, ensure secrets are correctly set and referenced using ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}.

Method Signatures: (These are YAML configurations rather than function calls, but the structure is strict and validated by GitHub Actions Runner.)

No exceptions are thrown at the YAML configuration level; errors are reported in logs and via the Actions UI.

# Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that enables automated build, test, and deployment pipelines directly in your repository. Workflows are defined using YAML files stored in the .github/workflows directory and are triggered by events in the repository.

# Workflow Structure
- Each workflow is defined by a YAML file with one or more jobs.
- A workflow is triggered by events (push, pull_request, schedule, manual dispatch) defined under the 'on:' key.
- Jobs run on a specified runner (e.g. ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS) and can include multiple sequential or parallel steps.

# Jobs and Steps
- Jobs: A set of steps that execute on the same runner. They can have dependencies defined by the 'needs:' keyword.
- Steps: Individual commands or actions in a job, executed in order. Each step can run a shell script or call an action.

# Actions and Runners
- Actions: Custom or community-built reusable units. For example, 'actions/checkout@v4' is used to clone your repository.
- Runners: Virtual machines or self-hosted machines that execute job steps. GitHub Actions offers Linux, Windows, and macOS runners.

# Advanced Workflow Features
- Matrix strategies: Allow running jobs against multiple configurations (e.g. different Node.js versions).
- Caching: Speed up workflows by caching dependencies (e.g. npm modules).
- Container services: Define ephemeral containers for databases or other services using the 'services:' key.
- Secrets: Secure storage and use of sensitive data, injected as environment variables.

# Sample YAML Workflow
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions 🚀
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 Running on ${{ runner.os }} hosted by GitHub"
      - run: echo "🔎 Branch: ${{ github.ref }}, Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "💡 Repository cloned."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "🍏 Job status: ${{ job.status }}"
