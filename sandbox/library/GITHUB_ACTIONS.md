# GITHUB_ACTIONS

## Crawl Summary
GitHub Actions provides a YAML-defined CI/CD platform. Key specifications include workflow triggers (on: events like push, pull_request, schedule), job definitions with runs-on parameter (ubuntu-latest, etc.), sequential steps with shell commands or action usage (actions/checkout@v4), and advanced features such as matrix, caching via actions/cache, service containers, and security via secrets and OpenID Connect. Workflows support explicit dependencies, event filters, and labeling for runner selection.

   - on key supports events: push, pull_request, schedule, workflow_dispatch
   - Event filters: branches, types for issues, labels, etc.
4. Advanced Features
   - Matrix: strategy: matrix: variable arrays (e.g., node: [14, 16])
   - Caching: use actions/cache with parameters path, key, restore-keys
   - Service Containers: using services keyword to spin a container (e.g., postgres)
5. Security and Deployment
   - Secrets management: ${{ secrets.VARIABLE }}
   - Environments and concurrency for controlled deployment

Detailed Technical Details:
Workflow YAML example used for CI/CD with multiple steps. Each step includes direct shell commands or action calls. The YAML syntax requires use of proper indentation and keys, including environment variable references with ${{ }}. The jobs can have dependencies set using needs: precedingJob. Matrix support enables parameterized multi-run jobs. Caching uses file hashes to determine cache keys. Sensitive tokens are injected via secrets to avoid hard-coded credentials.

## Supplementary Details
Technical Specifications:
- Workflow file location: .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml
- YAML keys: name, run-name, on, jobs
- runs-on parameter example: 'ubuntu-latest'
- Steps can use 'run' (command scripts) and 'uses' (GitHub actions with version tag, e.g., actions/checkout@v4)
- Matrix strategy: strategy: matrix: <variable>: [values]
- Caching example: actions/cache@v4 with 'path', 'key', and 'restore-keys' parameters
- Service container example: services: postgres with image: postgres, environment variables for host and port
- Security: secrets injected using ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
- Trigger events: push, fork, issues events with type filters
- Dependencies: using needs keyword to run jobs sequentially
- Environment configuration: Use environments for deployments to add protection rules
- Concurrency: Limit active deployments using concurrency attributes
- Default values: runs-on defaults to GitHub-hosted runner if not specified

## Reference Details
API Specifications and Implementation Details:
- Workflow definition structure:
  Key: name (string), run-name (string), on (array or object with event triggers), jobs (object mapping job name to job configuration)
- Job configuration:
  Property: runs-on (string or array of strings), steps (array of step objects), needs (optional, string or array indicating dependency)
- Step configuration:
  'run': Command string to execute shell commands
  'uses': String specifying action and version (e.g., actions/checkout@v4)
  'name': Optional name for the step
- Matrix Configuration:
  strategy: {
    matrix: { variable: [value1, value2, ...] }
  }
- Cache Configuration: 
  steps:
    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
- Service Container Example:
  jobs:
    container-job:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      container: node:20-bookworm-slim
      services:
        postgres:
          image: postgres
          env:
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
          ports:
            - 5432:5432
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: npm ci
        - run: node client.js
          env:
            POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
            POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
- Security Best Practices:
  - Do not hard code secrets; reference using ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
  - Limit job triggers to prevent recursive workflow runs
  - Use environments for sensitive deployment steps requiring manual approvals
- Troubleshooting Procedures:
  - Check workflow logs via GitHub Actions interface
  - Expand each step log to verify command outputs; expected outputs include echo messages and file listing via ls ${{ github.workspace }}
  - If caching fails, verify the key and restore-keys values and ensure that hashFiles function finds the specified files.
  - Validate YAML syntax with a linter before committing.
- SDK method signatures: (Not applicable for direct API calls; focus is on YAML configuration and GitHub CLI commands for workflow management.)
- Example GitHub CLI command for troubleshooting:
  gh run list
  gh run view <run-id>
  gh run cancel <run-id>
These examples and specifications are directly usable without modification for a GitHub Actions CI/CD setup.

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates build, test, and deployment pipelines using YAML-defined workflows. The workflows consist of events, jobs, and steps executed on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners.

## Workflow Basics
- Workflows are defined in YAML files located in the .github/workflows directory.
- A workflow requires an event trigger (e.g., push, pull_request) and contains one or more jobs.
- Each job runs on a designated runner (e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest) and is composed of sequential steps.

## Job and Step Configuration
- Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel. Dependency can be established using the needs keyword.
- Steps can execute shell scripts or run reusable actions via the 'uses' key.
- Example configuration:
  - runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  - steps: (shell command executions, checking out repository code using actions/checkout@v4)

## Workflow Triggers and Events
- Workflows are triggered by events defined under the 'on' key in YAML. Supported events include push, pull_request, schedule, and manual triggers.
- Advanced filtering options allow the use of event activity types (e.g., issues labeled or created) and branch specifications.

## Advanced Workflow Features
- Matrix strategies allow multiple job runs with different parameters, for example testing multiple Node.js versions.
- Caching dependencies is supported using actions/cache with configuration options like key generation based on OS and file hashes.
- Service containers (e.g., postgres) can be used to run databases for testing in ephemeral containers.
- Runners can be customized with labels to control job execution on self-hosted or GitHub-hosted machines.

## Security and Deployment
- Secrets are managed through GitHub secrets and injected as environment variables to protect sensitive information.
- Concurrency and environments provide control over deployment sequences and parallel job limitations.
- OpenID Connect configuration allows secure cloud resource access without long-lived secrets.

name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
