# GITHUB_ACTIONS

## Crawl Summary
GitHub Actions provides a YAML-defined workflow automation platform. Key technical details include event triggers (e.g., push, fork, schedule), job definitions with sequential or parallel steps, and reusable actions. Important configurations include runner selection (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest), job dependencies using 'needs', matrix strategies for parallel testing, caching strategies for dependencies, containerized services for ephemeral databases, and secrets management with GitHub secrets. The provided sample YAML demonstrates command execution, environment variable usage, and repository checkout via actions/checkout.

## Normalised Extract
Table of Contents:
  1. Workflow Configuration
    - YAML file in .github/workflows directory
    - File extension must be .yml or .yaml
    - Mandatory keys: name, run-name, on, jobs
  2. Event Triggers
    - on: trigger events such as push, pull_request, schedule
    - Supports manual and repository_dispatch events
  3. Job Execution
    - jobs defined with 'runs-on' specifying runner (e.g. ubuntu-latest)
    - Steps executed sequentially within a job
    - Use 'needs' to define job dependencies
  4. Actions and Steps
    - Steps can be shell commands or actions (e.g. actions/checkout@v4)
    - Environment variables referenced with ${{ github.event_name }}, ${{ runner.os }}, etc.
  5. Advanced Features
    - Matrix strategy: automatically create job runs with variables (e.g., matrix: { node: [14, 16] })
    - Caching: use actions/cache to store directories such as ~/.npm
    - Containerized services: define services to run ephemeral containers (e.g. postgres)

Detailed Technical Extract:
Workflow YAML example defines key parameters such as trigger (on: [push]), job specification (runs-on: ubuntu-latest) and multiple steps: echo commands, checkout code with actions/checkout@v4, listing repository files, and status reporting using ${{ job.status }}. Advanced implementations include referencing secrets in environment variables, dependency management between jobs using 'needs', and configuring matrix strategies with a key under strategy.matrix. Configuration options include setting labels for runners using runs-on arrays and using container definitions to integrate external services.

## Supplementary Details
Key Specifications:
- YAML File Location: .github/workflows
- Mandatory keys in workflow file: name, run-name, on, jobs, steps
- Runner Options: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest; custom labels possible
- Secrets Usage: Refer via ${{ secrets.[SECRET_NAME] }}; no embedding of long-lived credentials
- Matrix Configuration: Defined under jobs -> strategy -> matrix, e.g. node: [14, 16]
- Caching: actions/cache with parameters path, key, and restore-keys
- Container Services: Define 'container' with Docker image and 'services' dictionary to run extra containers
- Job Dependencies: Use 'needs' to enforce sequential execution
- Example YAML provided includes inline commands and multi-line scripts using | indicator

Implementation Steps:
1. Create .github/workflows directory (if absent).
2. Create a YAML file (e.g., github-actions-demo.yml) with .yml extension.
3. Define workflow name, trigger event under on, and jobs with their respective runners.
4. Include steps using run commands and actions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4).
5. Commit file to repository to trigger workflow.
6. Monitor execution via GitHub Actions UI and inspect logs for troubleshooting.

Workflow YAML Structure:
- File: .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml
- YAML structure:
  name: GitHub Actions Demo
  run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    Explore-GitHub-Actions:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
        - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
        - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
        - name: Check out repository code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
        - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
        - name: List files in the repository
          run: |
            ls ${{ github.workspace }}
        - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."

Configuration Options:
- Trigger: on: [push] (also supports events: pull_request, schedule, repository_dispatch)
- Runners: 'runs-on' value defines the OS environment; use array for label matching e.g. [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
- Secrets: Must be stored in repository secrets and invoked as ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}

Method Signatures & SDK Components (for Actions):
- actions/checkout@v4: No parameters required by default; configuration can include ref, repository, token, clean, fetch-depth

Example of caching configuration using actions/cache@v4:
  - name: Cache node modules
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    env:
      cache-name: cache-node-modules
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-

Troubleshooting Procedures:
1. Verify YAML format and indentation.
2. Confirm proper placement of workflow file in .github/workflows.
3. Review runner logs for step failures; use verbose echo commands to print variable values.
4. For caching issues, check key consistency using hashFiles() function returns.
5. For action failures, check version compatibility (e.g., actions/checkout@v4) and network access.
6. Use GitHub Actions UI to re-run workflow and inspect logs; if job dependencies fail, ensure 'needs' is correctly set.

Best Practices:
- Use minimal permissions with GITHUB_TOKEN
- Use matrix strategies to test across multiple environments
- Store sensitive parameters as secrets
- Use container services to isolate dependencies
- Regularly update action versions to latest stable releases

# GitHub Actions Documentation

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates build, test, and deployment pipelines. Workflows are defined in YAML files placed in the .github/workflows directory, and they execute on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners.

## Workflow Components
- Event Triggers: Workflows can be triggered by events such as push, pull_request, schedule, or manual invocation.
- Jobs: A workflow is composed of one or more jobs. Each job runs on a specified runner (e.g., ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest) and contains steps executed sequentially.
- Steps: Steps can be a shell command or an action (a reusable extension). They share the same runner and can pass data among themselves.
- Actions: Actions are custom tasks that simplify workflow creation. They can be sourced from GitHub Marketplace or authored by users.
- Runners: Runners execute the job. They are provisioned by GitHub or self-hosted with specific labels (e.g., linux, x64, gpu).

## Sample YAML Workflow
Below is a complete workflow YAML file example:

```
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Workflow Advanced Features
- Secrets Management: Store sensitive data like tokens (e.g., secrets.SUPERSECRET) and reference them in steps.
- Job Dependencies: Use the "needs" keyword to run jobs sequentially.
- Matrix Strategy: Run parallel jobs with variable combinations, e.g., different Node.js versions.
- Caching: Cache dependencies (e.g., ~/.npm) to speed up workflows.
- Containerized Services: Use the "services" keyword to run databases (e.g., postgres) as ephemeral containers.
- Runner Labels: Specify runner labels to target specific environments.
