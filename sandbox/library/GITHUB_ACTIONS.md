# GITHUB_ACTIONS

## Crawl Summary
Workflows are authored in YAML under .github/workflows with keys (name, on, jobs). Supported triggers include push, pull_request, schedule, manual, and more. Jobs are configured with 'runs-on' (e.g., ubuntu-latest), with steps that utilize either run commands or actions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4). Job dependencies are managed with 'needs'; matrix strategies execute jobs across multiple configurations; caching is implemented using actions/cache@v4 with keys based on OS and file hash; container services can be deployed via the container and services keys; secrets are injected using ${{ secrets.VAR_NAME }}. Detailed logs are available for troubleshooting errors.

1. Workflow Syntax: Workflows reside in .github/workflows with .yml/.yaml extensions. Mandatory keys: name (string), on (array/object), jobs (object).
2. Event Triggers: 'on' key accepts events such as push, pull_request, schedule, repository_dispatch. Filters like branches and activity types can be applied.
3. Job and Step Configuration: Jobs require 'runs-on' to specify virtual machine type (e.g., ubuntu-latest), with steps executing 'run' commands or using actions (e.g., actions/checkout@v4). For dependency, use 'needs' keyword.
4. Matrix Strategy: Implement using strategy: matrix: variable: [list]. This creates multiple job iterations. Example: matrix: { node: [14, 16] }.
5. Caching and Dependencies: Use actions/cache@v4 with parameters: path, key (e.g., ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}), and restore-keys.
6. Container Services: Jobs may run inside containers or use services with definitions like container: image and services: { name: { image: string } }.
7. Secrets and Environment: Secrets accessed via ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}; environment variables defined per step using env key.
8. Reusing Workflows: Use workflow_call to reference and reuse workflows across files.
9. Troubleshooting: Access detailed logs via GitHub Actions UI; expand step logs to inspect command output and job.status for errors.

## Supplementary Details
Technical Specifications:
- YAML Configuration: File must be in .github/workflows; file extension .yml/.yaml; mandatory keys include name, on, jobs.
- Event Triggers: on key supports array syntax (e.g., on: [push]) or object syntax (e.g., on: { push: { branches: [main] } }).
- Job Configuration: jobs:<job_name> with runs-on (e.g., ubuntu-latest), optional needs for sequential execution, and steps array. Each step must specify either a run command or use an action.
- Matrix Strategy: Define strategy: matrix: with key-value arrays; job steps dynamically reference matrix variables.
- Caching: Use actions/cache@v4 with parameters:
    path: Directory to cache (e.g., ~/.npm)
    key: Unique cache key, typically includes ${{ runner.os }} and hashFiles('**/package-lock.json')
    restore-keys: Fallback key pattern.
- Container Services: Jobs support container: and services: blocks; container: specifies docker image.
- Secrets: Referenced as ${{ secrets.NAME }}; ensures secure parameter injection.
- Advanced: Reusable workflows using workflow_call; OpenID Connect for secure cloud resource access; GitHub-hosted vs self-hosted runners configuration.

## Reference Details
API Specifications and Implementation Details:
- Workflow YAML Structure:
  name: <String>
  run-name: <String>
  on: <Array or Object> (e.g., on: [push])
  jobs: {
    <job_name>: {
      runs-on: <String> (e.g., ubuntu-latest),
      needs: <Optional: String or Array>,
      steps: [
        {
          run: <String> // Executes shell command, returns exit status
        },
        {
          name: <String>,
          uses: <Action>@<Version> (e.g., actions/checkout@v4),
          with: { <Parameter>: <Value> }
        }
      ]
    }
  }

- Full Code Example:
  name: GitHub Actions Demo
  run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    Explore-GitHub-Actions:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - run: echo "üéâ Job triggered by ${{ github.event_name }} event."
        - run: echo "üêß Running on ${{ runner.os }} server."
        - run: echo "üîé Branch: ${{ github.ref }}, Repository: ${{ github.repository }}."
        - name: Check out repository code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: echo "üí° Repository cloned."
        - name: List files in repository
          run: ls ${{ github.workspace }}
        - run: echo "üçè Job status: ${{ job.status }}."

- Matrix Execution Example:
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          node: [14, 16]
      steps:
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

- Caching Configuration Example:
  - name: Cache node modules
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-build-

- Troubleshooting Procedures:
  1. Navigate to the repository's Actions tab on GitHub.
  2. Select the desired workflow run and click on the specific job to view logs.
  3. Expand steps to inspect command outputs and verify environment variables (e.g., check echo outputs for ${{ github.event_name }}, ${{ runner.os }}, and ${{ job.status }}).
  4. If errors occur, use logs to identify the failing step and adjust the YAML configuration accordingly.

- Configuration Options and Effects:
  runs-on: Determines the VM (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest).
  needs: Orders job execution; dependent jobs run after referenced jobs succeed.
  strategy: matrix: Enables parallel execution of jobs across defined parameter sets.
  secrets: Provides secure access to credentials via ${{ secrets.NAME }}.
  actions/checkout@v4: Ensures repository code is cloned for further job steps.

Best Practices:
- Maintain workflow files in .github/workflows.
- Use specific version tags for actions (e.g., @v4) to ensure stability.
- Implement caching to reduce build times.
- Use job dependencies to control the execution sequence and prevent race conditions.
- Leverage GitHub secrets for all sensitive data and configuration parameters.
- Regularly review workflow logs and update configurations to handle new error cases.

Commands and Expected Outputs:
- Command: echo "üéâ Job triggered by ${{ github.event_name }} event." should output a message indicating the triggering event.
- Command: ls ${{ github.workspace }} should list repository files in the runner's workspace.
- Expected output for caching step: Confirmation messages indicating cache save or restore based on key matching.

# GitHub Actions Workflows
Date Retrieved: 2023-10-07

This document contains the complete technical details extracted from the GitHub Actions documentation. It provides the exact YAML workflow file specifications, event triggers, job configurations, matrix strategies, caching methods, container service configurations, secrets handling, and advanced features such as workflow reuse and troubleshooting procedures.

## Workflow Syntax
- Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory.
- File extensions must be .yml or .yaml.
- Mandatory keys: name (string), on (array or object), jobs (object).
- Example structure:
  name: <workflow name>
  run-name: <display name using context variables>
  on: [event1, event2, ...]
  jobs:
    <job_name>:
      runs-on: <runner label> (e.g., ubuntu-latest)
      steps: [ list of steps ]

## Event Triggers
- Use the 'on' key to trigger workflows. Supported events include push, pull_request, fork, repository_dispatch, schedule, and manual triggers.
- Advanced filtering available using activity types and branch filters.
- Example: 
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main, 'releases/**']

## Job and Step Configuration
- Jobs define the execution environment using the key runs-on. Valid options: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest.
- Jobs can be set to run sequentially by using the 'needs' keyword to specify dependencies.
- Steps in a job can execute shell commands (using 'run') or invoke an action (using 'uses').
- Example step:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

## Matrix Strategy
- The matrix strategy allows multiple runs of a job for different environments.
- Implemented as:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      key: [value1, value2, ...]
- Example:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

## Caching and Dependencies
- Caching is supported via actions/cache@v4.
- Essential parameters include:
  - path: the directory to cache (e.g. ~/.npm)
  - key: unique key for the cache, often using ${{ runner.os }} and hashFiles for dependencies (e.g. package-lock.json)
  - restore-keys: fallback keys
- Example snippet:
  - name: Cache node modules
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-build-

## Container Services
- Jobs can be executed within containers or use services to provide ephemeral databases or caches.
- Configuration:
  container: <docker-image> (e.g., node:20-bookworm-slim)
  services:
    postgres:
      image: postgres
- Environment variables can then reference ports and hosts provided by the container service.

## Secrets and Environment Variables
- Secrets are stored in GitHub and referenced using ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}.
- Environment variables can be defined at the step level using the 'env' key.

## Reusing Workflows
- Workflows can be referenced or triggered from other workflows to avoid duplication.
- Use workflow_call for reusability.

## Troubleshooting and Logs
- Workflow runs and job logs are accessible via the GitHub Actions UI.
- Expand step logs to view detailed error messages and command output.
