About GraphQL
The GraphQL data query language is:


A specification. The spec determines the validity of the schema on the API server. The schema determines the validity of client calls.


Strongly typed. The schema defines an API's type system and all object relationships.


Introspective. A client can query the schema for details about the schema.


Hierarchical. The shape of a GraphQL call mirrors the shape of the JSON data it returns. Nested fields let you query for and receive only the data you specify in a single round trip.


An application layer. GraphQL is not a storage model or a database query language. The graph refers to graph structures defined in the schema, where nodes define objects and edges define relationships between objects. The API traverses and returns application data based on the schema definitions, independent of how the data is stored.


Why GitHub is using GraphQL
GitHub chose GraphQL because it offers significantly more flexibility for our integrators. The ability to define precisely the data you want—and only the data you want—is a powerful advantage over traditional REST API endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the data you specify.
For more details about why GitHub invested in GraphQL, see the original announcement blog post.
About the GraphQL schema reference
The docs in the sidebar are generated from the GitHub GraphQL schema. All calls are validated and executed against the schema. Use these docs to find out what data you can call:


Allowed operations: queries and mutations.


Schema-defined types: scalars, objects, enums, interfaces, unions, and input objects.


You can access this same content via the Explorer Docs sidebar. Note that you may need to rely on both the docs and the schema validation to successfully call the GraphQL API.
For other information, such as authentication and rate limit details, check out the guides.

Breaking changes are any changes that might require action from our integrators. We divide these changes into two categories:

Breaking: Changes that will break existing queries to the GraphQL API. For example, removing a field would be a breaking change.
Dangerous: Changes that won't break existing queries but could affect the runtime behavior of clients. Adding an enum value is an example of a dangerous change.

We'll announce upcoming breaking changes at least three months before making changes to the GraphQL schema, to give integrators time to make the necessary adjustments. Changes go into effect on the first day of a quarter (January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, or October 1st). For example, if we announce a change on January 15th, it will be made on July 1st.Changes scheduled for 2026-04-01Breaking A change will be made to TeamRemoveRepositoryAuditEntry.userUrl.Description: userUrl will be removed.Reason:  The GraphQL audit-log is deprecated.

To pass schema validation, all GraphQL API calls must meet these standards:

Clients must supply a first or last argument on any connection.
Values of first and last must be within 1-100.
Individual calls cannot request more than 500,000 total nodes.

Calculating nodes in a call
These two examples show how to calculate the total nodes in a call.


Simple query:
query {
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 50) {
      edges {
        repository:node {
          name

          issues(first: 10) {
            totalCount
            edges {
              node {
                title
                bodyHTML
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Calculation:
50         = 50 repositories
 +
50 x 10  = 500 repository issues

            = 550 total nodes


Complex query:
query {
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 50) {
      edges {
        repository:node {
          name

          pullRequests(first: 20) {
            edges {
              pullRequest:node {
                title

                comments(first: 10) {
                  edges {
                    comment:node {
                      bodyHTML
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }

          issues(first: 20) {
            totalCount
            edges {
              issue:node {
                title
                bodyHTML

                comments(first: 10) {
                  edges {
                    comment:node {
                      bodyHTML
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    followers(first: 10) {
      edges {
        follower:node {
          login
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Calculation:
50              = 50 repositories
 +
50 x 20       = 1,000 pullRequests
 +
50 x 20 x 10 = 10,000 pullRequest comments
 +
50 x 20       = 1,000 issues
 +
50 x 20 x 10 = 10,000 issue comments
 +
10              = 10 followers

                 = 22,060 total nodes


Primary rate limit
The GraphQL API assigns points to each query and limits the points that you can use within a specific amount of time. This limit helps prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, and ensures that the API remains available for all users.
The REST API also has a separate primary rate limit. For more information, see Rate limits for the REST API.
In general, you can calculate your primary rate limit for the GraphQL API based on your method of authentication:

For users: 5,000 points per hour per user. This includes requests made with a personal access token as well as requests made by a GitHub App or OAuth app on behalf of a user that authorized the app. Requests made on a user's behalf by a GitHub App that is owned by a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization have a higher rate limit of 10,000 points per hour. Similarly, requests made on your behalf by an OAuth app that is owned or approved by a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization have a higher rate limit of 10,000 points per hour if you are a member of the GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization.
For GitHub App installations not on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization: 5,000 points per hour per installation. Installations that have more than 20 repositories receive another 50 points per hour for each repository. Installations that are on an organization that have more than 20 users receive another 50 points per hour for each user. The rate limit cannot increase beyond 12,500 points per hour. The rate limit for user access tokens (as opposed to installation access tokens) are dictated by the primary rate limit for users.
For GitHub App installations on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization: 10,000 points per hour per installation. The rate limit for user access tokens (as opposed to installation access tokens) are dictated by the primary rate limit for users.
For OAuth apps: 5,000 points per hour, or 10,000 points per hour if the app is owned by a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization. This only applies when the app uses their client ID and client secret to request public data. The rate limit for OAuth access tokens generated by a OAuth app are dictated by the primary rate limit for users.
For GITHUB_TOKEN in GitHub Actions workflows: 1,000 points per hour per repository. For requests to resources that belong to an enterprise account on GitHub.com, the limit is 15,000 points per hour per repository.

You can check the point value of a query or calculate the expected point value as described in the following sections. The formula for calculating points and the rate limit are subject to change.
Checking the status of your primary rate limit
You can use the headers that are sent with each response to determine the current status of your primary rate limit.





























Header nameDescriptionx-ratelimit-limitThe maximum number of points that you can use per hourx-ratelimit-remainingThe number of points remaining in the current rate limit windowx-ratelimit-usedThe number of points you have used in the current rate limit windowx-ratelimit-resetThe time at which the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch secondsx-ratelimit-resourceThe rate limit resource that the request counted against. For GraphQL requests, this will always be graphql.
You can also query the rateLimit object to check your rate limit. When possible, you should use the rate limit response headers instead of querying the API to check your rate limit.
query {
  viewer {
    login
  }
  rateLimit {
    limit
    remaining
    used
    resetAt
  }
}


























FieldDescriptionlimitThe maximum number of points that you can use per hourremainingThe number of points remaining in the current rate limit windowusedThe number of points you have used in the current rate limit windowresetAtThe time at which the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch seconds
Returning the point value of a query
You can return the point value of a query by querying the cost field on the rateLimit object:
query {
  viewer {
    login
  }
  rateLimit {
    cost
  }
}

Predicting the point value of a query
You can also roughly calculate the point value of a query before you make the query.

Add up the number of requests needed to fulfill each unique connection in the call. Assume every request will reach the first or last argument limits.
Divide the number by 100 and round the result to the nearest whole number to get the final aggregate point value. This step normalizes large numbers.

Note

The minimum point value of a call to the GraphQL API is 1.

Here's an example query and score calculation:
query {
  viewer {
    login
    repositories(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          id

          issues(first: 50) {
            edges {
              node {
                id

                labels(first: 60) {
                  edges {
                    node {

This query requires 5,101 requests to fulfill:

Although we're returning 100 repositories, the API has to connect to the viewer's account once to get the list of repositories. So, requests for repositories = 1
Although we're returning 50 issues, the API has to connect to each of the 100 repositories to get the list of issues. So, requests for issues = 100
Although we're returning 60 labels, the API has to connect to each of the 5,000 potential total issues to get the list of labels. So, requests for labels = 5,000
Total = 5,101

Dividing by 100 and rounding gives us the final score of the query: 51
Secondary rate limits
In addition to primary rate limits, GitHub enforces secondary rate limits in order to prevent abuse and keep the API available for all users.
You may encounter a secondary rate limit if you:

Make too many concurrent requests. No more than 100 concurrent requests are allowed. This limit is shared across the REST API and GraphQL API.
Make too many requests to a single endpoint per minute. No more than 900 points per minute are allowed for REST API endpoints, and no more than 2,000 points per minute are allowed for the GraphQL API endpoint. For more information about points, see Calculating points for the secondary rate limit.
Make too many requests per minute. No more than 90 seconds of CPU time per 60 seconds of real time is allowed. No more than 60 seconds of this CPU time may be for the GraphQL API. You can roughly estimate the CPU time by measuring the total response time for your API requests.
Make too many requests that consume excessive compute resources in a short period of time.
Create too much content on GitHub in a short amount of time. In general, no more than 80 content-generating requests per minute and no more than 500 content-generating requests per hour are allowed. Some endpoints have lower content creation limits. Content creation limits include actions taken on the GitHub web interface as well as via the REST API and GraphQL API.

These secondary rate limits are subject to change without notice. You may also encounter a secondary rate limit for undisclosed reasons.
Calculating points for the secondary rate limit
Some secondary rate limits are determined by the point values of requests. For GraphQL requests, these point values are separate from the point value calculations for the primary rate limit.

























RequestPointsGraphQL requests without mutations1GraphQL requests with mutations5Most REST API GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests1Most REST API POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE requests5
Some REST API endpoints have a different point cost that is not shared publicly.
Exceeding the rate limit
If you exceed your primary rate limit, the response status will still be 200, but you will receive an error message, and the value of the x-ratelimit-remaining header will be 0. You should not retry your request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header.
If you exceed a secondary rate limit, the response status will be 200 or 403, and you will receive an error message that indicates that you hit a secondary rate limit. If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed. If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not retry your request until after the time, in UTC epoch seconds, specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.
Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.
Staying under the rate limit
To avoid exceeding a rate limit, you should pause at least 1 second between mutative requests and avoid concurrent requests.
You should also subscribe to webhook events instead of polling the API for data. For more information, see Webhooks documentation.
You can also stream the audit log in order to view API requests. This can help you troubleshoot integrations that are exceeding the rate limit. For more information, see Streaming the audit log for your enterprise.
Timeouts
If GitHub takes more than 10 seconds to process an API request, GitHub will terminate the request and you will receive a timeout response and a message reporting that "We couldn't respond to your request in time".
GitHub reserves the right to change the timeout window to protect the speed and reliability of the API.
You can check the status of the GraphQL API at githubstatus.com to determine whether the timeout is due to a problem with the API. You can also try to simplify your request or try your request later. For example, if you are requesting a large number of objects in a single request, you can try requesting fewer objects split over multiple queries.\n\n\n\nGraphQL API/Reference/QueriesQueriesThe query type defines GraphQL operations that retrieve data from the server.In this articleAbout queriescodeOfConductcodesOfConductenterpriseenterpriseAdministratorInvitationenterpriseAdministratorInvitationByTokenenterpriseMemberInvitationenterpriseMemberInvitationByTokenidlicenselicensesmarketplaceCategoriesmarketplaceCategorymarketplaceListingmarketplaceListingsmetanodenodesorganizationrateLimitrelayrepositoryrepositoryOwnerresourcesearchsecurityAdvisoriessecurityAdvisorysecurityVulnerabilitiessponsorablestopicuserviewerAbout queries

Note

For GitHub App requests made with user access tokens, you should use separate queries for issues and pull requests. For example, use the is:issue or is:pull-request filters and their equivalents. Using the search connection to return a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query will result in an empty set of nodes.

This mutation creates a commit whose parent is the HEAD of the provided
branch and also updates that branch to point to the new commit.
It can be thought of as similar to git commit.
Locating a Branch
Commits are appended to a branch of type Ref.
This must refer to a git branch (i.e.  the fully qualified path must
begin with refs/heads/, although including this prefix is optional.
Callers may specify the branch to commit to either by its global node
ID or by passing both of repositoryNameWithOwner and refName.  For
more details see the documentation for CommittableBranch.
Describing Changes
fileChanges are specified as a FilesChanges object describing
FileAdditions and FileDeletions.
Please see the documentation for FileChanges for more information on
how to use this argument to describe any set of file changes.
Authorship
Similar to the web commit interface, this mutation does not support
specifying the author or committer of the commit and will not add
support for this in the future.
A commit created by a successful execution of this mutation will be
authored by the owner of the credential which authenticates the API
request.  The committer will be identical to that of commits authored
using the web interface.
If you need full control over author and committer information, please
use the Git Database REST API instead.

supported and will be marked as verified in the user interface.Input fields for createCommitOnBranchinput (CreateCommitOnBranchInput!)Return fields for createCommitOnBranchNameDescriptionclientMutationId (String)A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.commit (Commit)The new commit.ref (Ref)The ref which has been updated to point to the new commit.createDeploymentCreates a new deployment event.Input fields for createDeploymentinput (CreateDeploymentInput!)Return fields for createDeploymentNameDescriptionautoMerged (Boolean)True if the default branch has been auto-merged into the deployment ref.clientMutationId (String)A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.deployment (Deployment)The new deployment.createDeploymentStatusCreate a deployment status.Input fields for createDeploymentStatusinput (CreateDeploymentStatusInput!)Return fields for createDeploymentStatusNameDescriptionclientMutationId (String)A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.deploymentStatus (DeploymentStatus)The new deployment status.createDiscussionCreate a discussion.Input fields for createDiscussioninput (CreateDiscussionInput!)Return fields for createDiscussionNameDescriptionclientMutationId (String)A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.discussion (Discussion)The discussion that was just created.createEnterpriseOrganizationCreates an organization as part of an enterprise account.

input objects
Input objects can be described as "composable objects" because they include a set of input fields that define the object.
For example, CommitAuthor takes a field called emails. Providing a value for emails transforms CommitAuthor into a list of User objects containing that email address. Note that objects may have input objects, whereas mutations require input objects.

commit.  Any existing file at that that path will be replaced.Input fields for FileAdditionNameDescriptioncontents (Base64String!)The base64 encoded contents of the file.path (String!)The path in the repository where the file will be located.FileChangesA description of a set of changes to a file tree to be made as part of
a git commit, modeled as zero or more file additions and zero or more
file deletions.
Both fields are optional; omitting both will produce a commit with no
file changes.
deletions and additions describe changes to files identified
by their path in the git tree using unix-style path separators, i.e.
/.  The root of a git tree is an empty string, so paths are not
slash-prefixed.
path values must be unique across all additions and deletions
provided.  Any duplication will result in a validation error.
Encoding
File contents must be provided in full for each FileAddition.
The contents of a FileAddition must be encoded using RFC 4648
compliant base64, i.e. correct padding is required and no characters
outside the standard alphabet may be used.  Invalid base64
encoding will be rejected with a validation error.
The encoded contents may be binary.
For text files, no assumptions are made about the character encoding of
the file contents (after base64 decoding).  No charset transcoding or
line-ending normalization will be performed; it is the client's
responsibility to manage the character encoding of files they provide.
However, for maximum compatibility we recommend using UTF-8 encoding
and ensuring that all files in a repository use a consistent
line-ending convention (\n or \r\n), and that all files end
with a newline.
Modeling file changes
Each of the the five types of conceptual changes that can be made in a
git commit can be described using the FileChanges type as follows:


New file addition: create file hello world\n at path docs/README.txt:
{
  "additions" [
    {
      "path": "docs/README.txt",
      "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
    }
  ]
}



Existing file modification: change existing docs/README.txt to have new
content new content here\n:
{
  "additions" [
    {
      "path": "docs/README.txt",
      "contents": base64encode("new content here\n")
    }
  ]
}



Existing file deletion: remove existing file docs/README.txt.
Note that the path is required to exist -- specifying a
path that does not exist on the given branch will abort the
commit and return an error.
{
  "deletions" [
    {
      "path": "docs/README.txt"
    }
  ]
}



File rename with no changes: rename docs/README.txt with
previous content hello world\n to the same content at
newdocs/README.txt:
{
  "deletions" [
    {
      "path": "docs/README.txt",
    }
  ],
  "additions" [
    {
      "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
      "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
    }
  ]
}



File rename with changes: rename docs/README.txt with
previous content hello world\n to a file at path
newdocs/README.txt with content new contents\n:
{
  "deletions" [
    {
      "path": "docs/README.txt",
    }
  ],
  "additions" [
    {
      "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
      "contents": base64encode("new contents\n")
    }
  ]
}.

The GitHub GraphQL API represents an architectural and conceptual shift from the GitHub REST API. You will likely encounter some new terminology in the GraphQL API reference docs.
Schema
A schema defines a GraphQL API's type system. It describes the complete set of possible data (objects, fields, relationships, everything) that a client can access. Calls from the client are validated and executed against the schema. A client can find information about the schema via introspection. A schema resides on the GraphQL API server. For more information, see Discovering the GraphQL API.
Field
A field is a unit of data you can retrieve from an object. As the official GraphQL docs say:
"The GraphQL query language is basically about selecting fields on objects."
The official spec also says about fields:

All GraphQL operations must specify their selections down to fields which return scalar values to ensure an unambiguously shaped response.

This means that if you try to return a field that is not a scalar, schema validation will throw an error. You must add nested subfields until all fields return scalars.
Argument
An argument is a set of key-value pairs attached to a specific field. Some fields require an argument. Mutations require an input object as an argument.
Implementation
A GraphQL schema may use the term implements to define how an object inherits from an interface.
Here's a contrived example of a schema that defines interface X and object Y:
interface X {
  some_field: String!
  other_field: String!
}

type Y implements X {
  some_field: String!
  other_field: String!
  new_field: String!
}

This means object Y requires the same fields/arguments/return types that interface X does, while adding new fields specific to object Y. (The ! means the field is required.)
In the reference docs, you'll find that:


Each object lists the interface(s) from which it inherits under Implements.


Each interface lists the objects that inherit from it under Implementations.


Connection
Connections let you query related objects as part of the same call. With connections, you can use a single GraphQL call where you would have to use multiple calls to a REST API. For more information, see Migrating from REST to GraphQL.
It's helpful to picture a graph: dots connected by lines. The dots are nodes, the lines are edges. A connection defines a relationship between nodes.
Edge
Edges represent connections between nodes. When you query a connection, you traverse its edges to get to its nodes. Every edges field has a node field and a cursor field. Cursors are used for pagination. For more information, see Using pagination in the GraphQL API.
Node
Node is a generic term for an object. You can look up a node directly, or you can access related nodes via a connection. If you specify a node that does not return a scalar, you must include subfields until all fields return scalars. For information on accessing node IDs via the REST API and using them in GraphQL queries, see Using global node IDs.
Discovering the GraphQL API
GraphQL is introspective. This means you can query a GraphQL schema for details about itself.


Query __schema to list all types defined in the schema and get details about each:
query {
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
      fields {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}



Query __type to get details about any type:
query {
  __type(name: "Repository") {
    name
    kind
    description
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}



You can also run an introspection query of the schema via a GET request:
curl -H "Authorization: bearer TOKEN" https://api.github.com/graphql

Note

If you get the response "message": "Bad credentials" or 401 Unauthorized, check that you are using a valid token. If you receive a 403 error with Resource not accessible by personal access token, ensure that your fine-grained personal access token is targeted to the correct resource owner. For example, it must target the organization that owns the repository you are trying to access.

The results are in JSON, so we recommend pretty-printing them for easier reading and searching. You can use a command-line tool like jq or pipe the results into python -m json.tool for this purpose.
Alternatively, you can pass the idl media type to return the results in IDL format, which is a condensed version of the schema:
$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v4.idl" \
https://api.github.com/graphql

Note

The introspection query is probably the only GET request you'll run in GraphQL. If you're passing a body, the GraphQL request method is POST, whether it's a query or a mutation.

For more information about performing queries, see Forming calls with GraphQL.\n\n\n\nGraphQL API/Guides/Form calls with GraphQLForming calls with GraphQLLearn how to authenticate to the GraphQL API, then learn how to create and run queries and mutations.In this articleAuthenticating with GraphQLThe GraphQL endpointCommunicating with GraphQLWorking with variablesExample queryExample mutationFurther readingAuthenticating with GraphQL
You can authenticate to the GraphQL API using a personal access token, GitHub App, or OAuth app.
Authenticating with a personal access token
To authenticate with a personal access token, follow the steps in Managing your personal access tokens. The data that you are requesting will dictate which scopes or permissions you will need.
For example, select the "issues:read" permission to read all of the issues in the repositories your token has access to.
All fine-grained personal access tokens include read access to public repositories. To access public repositories with a personal access token (classic), select the "public_repo" scope.
If your token does not have the required scopes or permissions to access a resource, the API will return an error message that states the scopes or permissions your token needs.
Authenticating with a GitHub App
If you want to use the API on behalf of an organization or another user, GitHub recommends that you use a GitHub App. In order to attribute activity to your app, you can make your app authenticate as an app installation. In order to attribute app activity to a user, you can make your app authenticate on behalf of a user. In both cases, you will generate a token that you can use to authenticate to the GraphQL API. For more information, see Registering a GitHub App and About authentication with a GitHub App.
Authenticating with a OAuth app
To authenticate with an OAuth token from an OAuth app, you must first authorize your OAuth app using either a web application flow or device flow. Then, you can use the access token that you received to access the API. For more information, see Creating an OAuth app and Authorizing OAuth apps.
The GraphQL endpoint
The REST API has numerous endpoints. With the GraphQL API, the endpoint remains constant, no matter what operation you perform. For GitHub.com, that endpoint is:
https://api.github.com/graphql
Communicating with GraphQL
Because GraphQL operations consist of multiline JSON, GitHub recommends using the Explorer to make GraphQL calls. You can also use curl or any other HTTP-speaking library.
In REST, HTTP verbs determine the operation performed. In GraphQL, you'll provide a JSON-encoded body whether you're performing a query or a mutation, so the HTTP verb is POST. The exception is an introspection query, which is a simple GET to the endpoint. For more information on GraphQL versus REST, see Migrating from REST to GraphQL.
To query GraphQL in a curl command, make a POST request with a JSON payload. The payload must contain a string called query:
curl -H "Authorization: bearer TOKEN" -X POST -d " \
 { \
   \"query\": \"query { viewer { login }}\" \
 } \
" https://api.github.com/graphql

Note

The string value of "query" must escape newline characters or the schema will not parse it correctly. For the POST body, use outer double quotes and escaped inner double quotes.

About query and mutation operations
The two types of allowed operations in GitHub's GraphQL API are queries and mutations. Comparing GraphQL to REST, queries operate like GET requests, while mutations operate like POST/PATCH/DELETE. The mutation name determines which modification is executed.
For information about rate limiting, see Rate limits and node limits for the GraphQL API.
Queries and mutations share similar forms, with some important differences.
About queries
GraphQL queries return only the data you specify. To form a query, you must specify fields within fields (also known as nested subfields) until you return only scalars.
Queries are structured like this:
query {
  JSON-OBJECT-TO-RETURN
}
For a real-world example, see Example query.
About mutations
To form a mutation, you must specify three things:

Mutation name. The type of modification you want to perform.
Input object. The data you want to send to the server, composed of input fields. Pass it as an argument to the mutation name.
Payload object. The data you want to return from the server, composed of return fields. Pass it as the body of the mutation name.

Mutations are structured like this:
mutation {
  MUTATION-NAME(input: {MUTATION-NAME-INPUT!}) {
    MUTATION-NAME-PAYLOAD
  }
}
The input object in this example is MutationNameInput, and the payload object is MutationNamePayload.
In the mutations reference, the listed input fields are what you pass as the input object. The listed return fields are what you pass as the payload object.
For a real-world example, see Example mutation.
Working with variables
Variables can make queries more dynamic and powerful, and they can reduce complexity when passing mutation input objects.
Note

If you're using the Explorer, make sure to enter variables in the separate Query Variables pane, and do not include the word variables before the JSON object.

Here's an example query with a single variable:
query($number_of_repos:Int!) {
  viewer {
    name
     repositories(last: $number_of_repos) {
       nodes {
         name
       }
     }
   }
}
variables {
   "number_of_repos": 3
}

There are three steps to using variables:


Define the variable outside the operation in a variables object:
variables {
   "number_of_repos": 3
}

The object must be valid JSON. This example shows a simple Int variable type, but it's possible to define more complex variable types, such as input objects. You can also define multiple variables here.


Pass the variable to the operation as an argument:
query($number_of_repos:Int!){

The argument is a key-value pair, where the key is the name starting with $ (e.g., $number_of_repos), and the value is the type (e.g., Int). Add a ! to indicate whether the type is required. If you've defined multiple variables, include them here as multiple arguments.


Use the variable within the operation:
repositories(last: $number_of_repos) {

In this example, we substitute the variable for the number of repositories to retrieve. We specify a type in step 2 because GraphQL enforces strong typing.


This process makes the query argument dynamic. We can now simply change the value in the variables object and keep the rest of the query the same.
Using variables as arguments lets you dynamically update values in the variables object without changing the query.
Example query
Let's walk through a more complex query and put this information in context.
The following query looks up the octocat/Hello-World repository, finds the 20 most recent closed issues, and returns each issue's title, URL, and first 5 labels:
query {
  repository(owner:"octocat", name:"Hello-World") {
    issues(last:20, states:CLOSED) {
      edges {
        node {
          title
          url
          labels(first:5) {
            edges {
              node {
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Looking at the composition line by line:


query {
Because we want to read data from the server, not modify it, query is the root operation. (If you don't specify an operation, query is also the default.)


repository(owner:"octocat", name:"Hello-World") {
To begin the query, we want to find a repository object. The schema validation indicates this object requires an owner and a name argument.


issues(last:20, states:CLOSED) {
To account for all issues in the repository, we call the issues object. (We could query a single issue on a repository, but that would require us to know the number of the issue we want to return and provide it as an argument.)
Some details about the issues object:

The docs tell us this object has the type IssueConnection.
Schema validation indicates this object requires a last or first number of results as an argument, so we provide 20.
The docs also tell us this object accepts a states argument, which is an IssueState enum that accepts OPEN or CLOSED values. To find only closed issues, we give the states key a value of CLOSED.



edges {
We know issues is a connection because it has the IssueConnection type. To retrieve data about individual issues, we have to access the node via edges.


node {
Here we retrieve the node at the end of the edge. The IssueConnection docs indicate the node at the end of the IssueConnection type is an Issue object.


Now that we know we're retrieving an Issue object, we can look at the docs and specify the fields we want to return:
title
url
labels(first:5) {
  edges {
    node {
      name
    }
  }
}

Here we specify the title, url, and labels fields of the Issue object.
The labels field has the type LabelConnection. As with the issues object, because labels is a connection, we must travel its edges to a connected node: the label object. At the node, we can specify the label object fields we want to return, in this case, name.


You may notice that running this query on the Octocat's public Hello-World repository won't return many labels. Try running it on one of your own repositories that does use labels, and you'll likely see a difference.
Example mutation
Mutations often require information that you can only find out by performing a query first. This example shows two operations:

A query to get an issue ID.
A mutation to add an emoji reaction to the issue.

query FindIssueID {
  repository(owner:"octocat", name:"Hello-World") {
    issue(number:349) {
      id
    }
  }
}

mutation AddReactionToIssue {
  addReaction(input:{subjectId:"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzEzOTE1NTE=",content:HOORAY}) {
    reaction {
      content
    }
    subject {
      id
    }
  }
}

Tip

Although you can include a query and a mutation in the same Explorer window if you give them names (FindIssueID and AddReactionToIssue in this example), the operations will be executed as separate calls to the GraphQL endpoint. It's not possible to perform a query at the same time as a mutation, or vice versa.

Let's walk through the example. The task sounds simple: add an emoji reaction to an issue.
So how do we know to begin with a query? We don't, yet.
Because we want to modify data on the server (attach an emoji to an issue), we begin by searching the schema for a helpful mutation. The reference docs show the addReaction mutation, with this description: Adds a reaction to a subject. Perfect!
The docs for the mutation list three input fields:

clientMutationId (String)
subjectId (ID!)
content (ReactionContent!)

The !s indicate that subjectId and content are required fields. A required content makes sense: we want to add a reaction, so we'll need to specify which emoji to use.
But why is subjectId required? It's because the subjectId is the only way to identify which issue in which repository to react to.
This is why we start this example with a query: to get the ID.
Let's examine the query line by line:


query FindIssueID {
Here we're performing a query, and we name it FindIssueID. Note that naming a query is optional; we give it a name here so that we can include it in same Explorer window as the mutation.


repository(owner:"octocat", name:"Hello-World") {
We specify the repository by querying the repository object and passing owner and name arguments.


issue(number:349) {
We specify the issue to react to by querying the issue object and passing a number argument.


id
This is where we retrieve the id of https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/issues/349 to pass as the subjectId.


When we run the query, we get the id: MDU6SXNzdWUyMzEzOTE1NTE=
Note

The id returned in the query is the value we'll pass as the subjectID in the mutation. Neither the docs nor schema introspection will indicate this relationship; you'll need to understand the concepts behind the names to figure this out.

With the ID known, we can proceed with the mutation:


mutation AddReactionToIssue {
Here we're performing a mutation, and we name it AddReactionToIssue. As with queries, naming a mutation is optional; we give it a name here so we can include it in the same Explorer window as the query.


addReaction(input:{subjectId:"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzEzOTE1NTE=",content:HOORAY}) {
Let's examine this line:

addReaction is the name of the mutation.
input is the required argument key. This will always be input for a mutation.
{subjectId:"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzEzOTE1NTE=",content:HOORAY} is the required argument value. This will always be an input object (hence the curly braces) composed of input fields (subjectId and content in this case) for a mutation.

How do we know which value to use for the content? The addReaction docs tell us the content field has the type ReactionContent, which is an enum because only certain emoji reactions are supported on GitHub issues. These are the allowed values for reactions (note some values differ from their corresponding emoji names):



Content
Emoji




+1
👍


-1
👎


laugh
😄


confused
😕


heart
❤️


hooray
🎉


rocket
🚀


eyes
👀





The rest of the call is composed of the payload object. This is where we specify the data we want the server to return after we've performed the mutation. These lines come from the addReaction docs, which three possible return fields:

clientMutationId (String)
reaction (Reaction!)
subject (Reactable!)

In this example, we return the two required fields (reaction and subject), both of which have required subfields (respectively, content and id).


When we run the mutation, this is the response:
{
  "data": {
    "addReaction": {
      "reaction": {
        "content": "HOORAY"
      },
      "subject": {
        "id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyMTc5NTQ0OTc="
      }
    }
  }
}

That's it! Check out your reaction to the issue by hovering over the 🎉 to find your username.
One final note: when you pass multiple fields in an input object, the syntax can get unwieldy. Moving the fields into a variable can help. Here's how you could rewrite the original mutation using a variable:
mutation($myVar:AddReactionInput!) {
  addReaction(input:$myVar) {
    reaction {
      content
    }
    subject {
      id
    }
  }
}
variables {
  "myVar": {
    "subjectId":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTc5NTQ0OTc=",
    "content":"HOORAY"
  }
}

Note

You may notice that the content field value in the earlier example (where it's used directly in the mutation) does not have quotes around HOORAY, but it does have quotes when used in the variable. There's a reason for this:

When you use content directly in the mutation, the schema expects the value to be of type ReactionContent, which is an enum, not a string. Schema validation will throw an error if you add quotes around the enum value, as quotes are reserved for strings.
When you use content in a variable, the variables section must be valid JSON, so the quotes are required. Schema validation correctly interprets the ReactionContent type when the variable is passed into the mutation during execution.

For more information on the difference between enums and strings, see the official GraphQL spec.

Do a direct node lookup in GraphQLUsing global node IDs in migrationsYou can access most objects in GitHub (users, issues, pull requests, etc.) using either the REST API or the GraphQL API. You can find the global node ID of many objects from within the REST API and use these IDs in your GraphQL operations. For more information, see Preview GraphQL API Node IDs in REST API resources.
Note

In REST, the global node ID field is named node_id. In GraphQL, it's an id field on the node interface. For a refresher on what "node" means in GraphQL, see Introduction to GraphQL.

Putting global node IDs to use
You can follow three steps to use global node IDs effectively:

Call a REST endpoint that returns an object's node_id.
Find the object's type in GraphQL.
Use the ID and type to do a direct node lookup in GraphQL.

Let's walk through an example.
1. Call a REST endpoint that returns an object's node ID
If you request the authenticated user:
curl -i --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user

you'll get a response that includes the node_id of the authenticated user:
{
  "login": "octocat",
  "id": 1,
  "avatar_url": "https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif",

}

2. Find the object type in GraphQL
In this example, the node_id value is MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzIzMQ==. You can use this value to query the same object in GraphQL.
You'll need to know the object's type first, though. You can check the type with a simple GraphQL query:
query {
  node(id:"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzIzMQ==") {
     __typename
  }
}

This type of query—that is, finding the node by ID—is known as a "direct node lookup."
When you run this query, you'll see that the __typename is User.
3. Do a direct node lookup in GraphQL
Once you've confirmed the type, you can use an inline fragment to access the object by its ID and return additional data. In this example, we define the fields on User that we'd like to query:
query {
  node(id:"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzIzMQ==") {
   ... on User {
      name
      login
    }
  }
}

This type of query is the standard approach for looking up an object by its global node ID.
Using global node IDs in migrations
When building integrations that use either the REST API or the GraphQL API, it's best practice to persist the global node ID so you can easily reference objects across API versions. For more information on handling the transition between REST and GraphQL, see Migrating from REST to GraphQL.\n\n\n\nGraphQL API/Guides/Migrate from REST to GraphQLMigrating from REST to GraphQLLearn best practices and considerations for migrating from GitHub's REST API to GitHub's GraphQL API.In this articleDifferences in API logicExample: Getting the data you need and nothing moreExample: NestingExample: Strong typingDifferences in API logic
GitHub provides two APIs: a REST API and a GraphQL API. For more information about GitHub's APIs, see Comparing GitHub's REST API and GraphQL API.
Migrating from REST to GraphQL represents a significant shift in API logic. The differences between REST as a style and GraphQL as a specification make it difficult—and often undesirable—to replace REST API calls with GraphQL API queries on a one-to-one basis. We've included specific examples of migration below.
To migrate your code from the REST API to the GraphQL API:

Review the GraphQL spec
Review GitHub's GraphQL schema
Consider how any existing code you have currently interacts with the GitHub REST API
Use Global Node IDs to reference objects between API versions

Significant advantages of GraphQL include:

Getting the data you need and nothing more
Nested fields
Strong typing

Here are examples of each.
Example: Getting the data you need and nothing more
A single REST API call retrieves a list of your organization's members:
curl -v https://api.github.com/orgs/:org/members

The REST payload contains excessive data if your goal is to retrieve only member names and links to avatars. However, a GraphQL query returns only what you specify:
query {
    organization(login:"github") {
    membersWithRole(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          avatarUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Consider another example: retrieving a list of pull requests and checking if each one is mergeable. A call to the REST API retrieves a list of pull requests and their summary representations:
curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls

Determining if a pull request is mergeable requires retrieving each pull request individually for its detailed representation (a large payload) and checking whether its mergeable attribute is true or false:
curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number

With GraphQL, you could retrieve only the number and mergeable attributes for each pull request:
query {
    repository(owner:"octocat", name:"Hello-World") {
    pullRequests(last: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          number
          mergeable
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Example: Nesting
Querying with nested fields lets you replace multiple REST calls with fewer GraphQL queries. For example, retrieving a pull request along with its commits, non-review comments, and reviews using the REST API requires four separate calls:
curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number
curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/commits
curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/comments
curl -v https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/reviews

Using the GraphQL API, you can retrieve the data with a single query using nested fields:
{
  repository(owner: "octocat", name: "Hello-World") {
    pullRequest(number: 1) {
      commits(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            commit {

            body

            state
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

You can also extend the power of this query by substituting a variable for the pull request number.
Example: Strong typing
GraphQL schemas are strongly typed, making data handling safer.
Consider an example of adding a comment to an issue or pull request using a GraphQL mutation, and mistakenly specifying an integer rather than a string for the value of clientMutationId:
mutation {
  addComment(input:{clientMutationId: 1234, subjectId: "MDA6SXNzdWUyMjcyMDA2MTT=", body: "Looks good to me!"}) {
    clientMutationId
    commentEdge {
      node {
        body
        repository {
          id
          name
          nameWithOwner
        }
        issue {
          number
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Executing this query returns errors specifying the expected types for the operation:
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Argument 'input' on Field 'addComment' has an invalid value. Expected type 'AddCommentInput!'.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 3,
          "column": 3
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "message": "Argument 'clientMutationId' on InputObject 'AddCommentInput' has an invalid value. Expected type 'String'.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 3,
          "column": 20
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Wrapping 1234 in quotes transforms the value from an integer into a string, the expected type:
mutation {
  addComment(input:{clientMutationId: "1234", subjectId: "MDA6SXNzdWUyMjcyMDA2MTT=", body: "Looks good to me!"}) {
    clientMutationId
    commentEdge {
      node {
        body
        repository {
          id
          name
          nameWithOwner
        }
        issue {
          number
        }
      }
    }
  }

GraphQL Explorer is an instance of GraphiQL, which is a "graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE."
Query autocompletion
You can use query autocompletion to help you build queries. In the main pane, within the curly brackets of your query, use control+space or shift+space to display the autocomplete menu.
Accessing the sidebar docs
All types in a GraphQL schema include a description field compiled into documentation. The collapsible Docs pane on the right side of the Explorer page allows you to browse documentation about the type system. The docs are automatically updated and will drop fields that are closing down.
Note

The Docs sidebar contains the same content that is automatically generated from the schema under GitHub GraphQL API documentation, though it is formatted differently in places.

Using the variable pane
Some example calls include variables written like this:
query($number_of_repos:Int!){
  viewer {
    name
     repositories(last: $number_of_repos) {
       nodes {
         name
       }
     }
   }
}
variables {
   "number_of_repos": 3
}

This is the correct format to submit the call using a POST request in a curl command (as long as you escape newlines).
If you want to run the call in the Explorer, enter the query segment in the main pane and the variables in the Query Variables pane below it. Omit the word variables from the Explorer:
{
   "number_of_repos": 3
}

Using the Altair GraphQL Client IDE
There are many open source GraphQL client IDEs. For example, you can use Altair to access GitHub's GraphQL API. To access the GraphQL API with Altair, download and install it from altair-graphql/altair. Then, follow the configuration steps below.
Configuring Altair

Get an access token.
Launch Altair.
In the left sidebar, below the Altair logo, click Set Headers. A new window will open.
In the "Header key" field, enter Authorization.
In the "Header value" field, enter Bearer TOKEN, replacing TOKEN with your token from the first step.
Click Save in the bottom right corner of the window to save your authorization header.
In the "GraphQL Endpoint" field, enter your GraphQL URL, such as https://api.github.com/graphql.
To load the GitHub GraphQL schema, download the public schema.
In Altair, click on Docs on the top right, then the three dots and Load Schema...
Select the file public schema that you downloaded in an earlier step.

Note

For more information about why POST is the method, see Forming calls with GraphQL.

You can test your access by querying yourself:
query {
  viewer {
    login
  }
}

If everything worked correctly, this will display your login. You're all set to start making queries.
Requesting support
For questions, bug reports, and discussions about GitHub Apps, OAuth apps, and API development, explore the API and Webhooks category in GitHub's Community Discussions. The discussions are moderated and maintained by GitHub staff, and answered by the GitHub community.
Consider reaching out to GitHub Support directly using the contact form for:

Guaranteed response from GitHub staff
Support requests involving sensitive data or private concerns
Feature requests
Feedback about GitHub products

Troubleshooting errors
Because GraphQL is introspective, the Explorer supports:

Intelligent typeaheads aware of the current schema
Validation error previews as you type

If you enter a query that is not well-formed or does not pass schema validation, a popup warns you of an error. If you run the query, the error returns in the response pane.
A GraphQL response contains several keys: a data hash and an errors array.
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Objects must have selections (field 'nodes' returns Repository but has no selections)",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 5,
          "column": 8
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

It's possible you might run into an unexpected error that is not related to the schema. If this happens, the message will include a reference code you can use when reporting the issue:
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Something went wrong while executing your query. This is most likely a GitHub bug. Please include \"7571:3FF6:552G94B:69F45B7:5913BBEQ\" when reporting this issue."
    }
  ]
}

Note

GitHub recommends checking for errors before using data in a production environment. In GraphQL, failure is not total: portions of GraphQL queries may succeed while others fail.\n\n\n\nGraphQL API/Guides/PaginationUsing pagination in the GraphQL APILearn how to traverse data sets using cursor based pagination with the GraphQL API.In this articleAbout paginationRequesting a cursor in your queryChanging the number of items per pageTraversing the data set using paginationNext stepsAbout pagination
GitHub's GraphQL API limits the number of items that you can fetch in a single request in order to protect against excessive or abusive requests to GitHub's servers. When you use the GraphQL API, you must supply a first or last argument on any connection. The value of these arguments must be between 1 and 100. The GraphQL API will return the number of connections specified by the first or last argument.
If the data that you are accessing has more connections than the number of items specified by the first or last argument, the response is divided into smaller "pages" of the specified size. These pages can be fetched one at a time until the entire data set has been retrieved. Each page contains the number of items specified by the first or last argument, unless it is the last page, which may contain a lower number of items.
This guide demonstrates how to request additional pages of results for paginated responses, how to change the number of results returned on each page, and how to write a script to fetch multiple pages of results.
Requesting a cursor in your query
When using the GraphQL API, you use cursors to traverse through a paginated data set. The cursor represents a specific position in the data set. You can get the first and last cursor on a page by querying the pageInfo object. For example:
query($owner: String!, $name: String!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequests(first: 100, after: null) {
      nodes {
        createdAt
        number
        title
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        startCursor
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }
    }
  }
}

In this example, pageInfo.startCursor gives the cursor for the first item on the page. pageInfo.endCursor gives the cursor for the last item on the page. pageInfo.hasNextPage and pageInfo.hasPreviousPage indicate whether there is a page before and after the page that was returned.
Changing the number of items per page
The first and last arguments control how many items are returned. The maximum number of items you can fetch using the first or last argument is 100. You may need to request fewer than 100 items if your query touches a lot of data in order to avoid hitting a rate or node limit. For more information, see Rate limits and node limits for the GraphQL API.
Traversing the data set using pagination
Once you return a cursor from a query, you can use the cursor to request the next page of results. To do so, you will use the after or before argument and the cursor.
For example, assuming the pageInfo.endCursor value from the previous example was Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOUH8B7g==, you can use this query to request the next page of results:
query($owner: String!, $name: String!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequests(first: 1, after: "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOUH8B7g==") {
      nodes {
        createdAt
        number
        title
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }
    }
  }
}

You can continue to send queries with the new pageInfo.endCursor value returned in the response until there are no pages left to traverse, indicated by pageInfo.hasNextPage returning false.
If you specified the last instead of the first argument, the last page of results will be returned first. In this case, you will use the pageInfo.startCursor value and the before argument to get the previous page of results. Once pageInfo.hasPreviousPage returns false, you have reached the last page. For example:
query($owner: String!, $name: String!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequests(last: 1, before: "R3Vyc29yOnYyOpHOHcfoOg==") {
      nodes {
        createdAt
        number
        title
      }
      pageInfo {
        startCursor
        hasPreviousPage
      }
    }
  }
}

Mutations
These mutations follow the same implementation pattern that other mutations in the GraphQL API. Each mutation accepts a single argument of an Input type, named after the mutation, and returns a Payload type containing the fields specified.
For example, this is a basic createDiscussion mutation that will create a new discussion:
mutation {
  # input type: CreateDiscussionInput
  createDiscussion(input: {repositoryId: "1234", categoryId: "5678", body: "The body", title: "The title"}) {

    # response type: CreateDiscussionPayload
    discussion {
      id
    }
  }
}

The GitHub GraphQL API currently supports two types of global node ID formats. The legacy format will be closing down and replaced with a new format. This guide shows you how to migrate to the new format, if necessary.
By migrating to the new format, you ensure that the response times of your requests remain consistent and small. You also ensure that your application continues to work once the legacy IDs are closing down.
To learn more about why the legacy global node ID format will be closing down, see New global ID format coming to GraphQL.
Determining if you need to take action
You only need to follow the migration steps if you store references to GraphQL global node IDs. These IDs correspond to the id field for any object in the schema. If you don't store any global node IDs, then you can continue to interact with the API with no change.
Additionally, if you currently decode the legacy IDs to extract type information (for example, if you use the first two characters of PR_kwDOAHz1OX4uYAah to determine if the object is a pull request), your service will break since the format of the IDs has changed. You should migrate your service to treat these IDs as opaque strings. These IDs will be unique, therefore you can rely on them directly as references.
Migrating to the new global IDs
To facilitate migration to the new ID format, you can use the X-Github-Next-Global-ID header in your GraphQL API requests. The value of the X-Github-Next-Global-ID header can be 1 or 0. Setting the value to 1 will force the response payload to always use the new ID format for any object that you requested the id field for. Setting the value to 0 will revert to default behavior, which is to show the legacy ID or new ID depending on the object creation date.
Here is an example request using a curl command:
$ curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Github-Next-Global-ID: 1" \
  https://api.github.com/graphql \
  -d '{ "query": "{ node(id: \"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDczMDM=\") { id } }" }'

Even though the legacy ID MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDczMDM= was used in the query, the response will contain the new ID format:
{"data":{"node":{"id":"U_kgDOADP9xw"}}}

With the X-Github-Next-Global-ID header, you can find the new ID format for legacy IDs that you reference in your application. You can then update those references with the ID received in the response. You should update all references to legacy IDs and use the new ID format for any subsequent requests to the API.
To perform bulk operations, you can use aliases to submit multiple node queries in one API call. For more information, see the GraphQL docs.
You can also get the new ID for a collection of items. For example, if you wanted to get the new ID for the last 10 repositories in your organization, you could use a query like this:
{
  organization(login: "github") {
    repositories(last: 10) {
      edges {
        cursor
        node {
          name
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Note that setting X-Github-Next-Global-ID to 1 will affect the return value of every id field in your query. This means that even when you submit a non-node query, you will get back the new format ID if you requested the id field.

To help you monitor and make changes in your organizations and maintain compliance, you can use the Enterprise Accounts API and the Audit Log API, which are only available as GraphQL APIs.
The enterprise account endpoints work for both GitHub Enterprise Cloud and for GitHub Enterprise Server.
GraphQL allows you to request and return just the data you specify. For example, you can create a GraphQL query, or request for information, to see all the new organization members added to your organization. Or you can make a mutation, or change, to invite an administrator to your enterprise account.
With the Audit Log API, you can monitor when someone:

Accesses your organization or repository settings.
Changes permissions.
Adds or removes users in an organization, repository, or team.
Promotes users to admin.
Changes permissions of a GitHub App.

The Audit Log API enables you to keep copies of your audit log data. For queries made with the Audit Log API, the GraphQL response can include data for up to 90 to 120 days. For a list of the fields available with the Audit Log API, see the Interfaces.
With the Enterprise Accounts API, you can:

List and review all of the organizations and repositories that belong to your enterprise account.
Change Enterprise account settings.
Configure policies for settings on your enterprise account and its organizations.
Invite administrators to your enterprise account.
Create new organizations in your enterprise account.

For a list of the fields available with the Enterprise Accounts API, see Managing enterprise accounts.
Getting started using GraphQL for enterprise accounts
Follow these steps to get started using GraphQL to manage your enterprise accounts:

Authenticating with a personal access token
Choosing a GraphQL client or using the GraphQL Explorer
Setting up Insomnia to use the GraphQL API

For some example queries, see An example query using the Enterprise Accounts API.
1. Authenticate with your personal access token


To authenticate with GraphQL, you need to generate a personal access token from developer settings. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens.


Grant admin and full control permissions to your personal access token for areas of your enterprise you'd like to access. For full permission to private repositories, organizations, teams, user data, and access to enterprise billing and profile data, we recommend you select these scopes for your personal access token:

repo
admin:org
user
admin:enterprise

The enterprise account specific scopes are:

admin:enterprise: Gives full control of enterprises (includes manage_runners:enterprise, manage_billing:enterprise and read:enterprise)
manage_billing:enterprise: Read and write enterprise billing data.
read:enterprise: Read enterprise profile data.



Copy your personal access token and keep it in a secure place until you add it to your GraphQL client.


2. Choose a GraphQL client
We recommend you use GraphiQL or another standalone GraphQL client that lets you configure the base URL.
You may also consider using these GraphQL clients:

Insomnia
GraphiQL
Postman

The next steps will use Insomnia.
3. Setting up Insomnia to use the GitHub GraphQL API with enterprise accounts


Add the base url and POST method to your GraphQL client. When using GraphQL to request information (queries), change information (mutations), or transfer data using the GitHub API, the default HTTP method is POST and the base url follows this syntax:

For your enterprise instance: https://<HOST>/api/graphql
For GitHub Enterprise Cloud: https://api.github.com/graphql



Select the "Auth" menu and click Bearer Token. If you've previously selected a different authentication method, the menu will be labeled with that method, such as "Basic Auth", instead.



In the "TOKEN" field, enter your personal access token from an earlier step.



Click Headers.



Under the Headers tab, click Add.


In the "header" field, enter Content-Type.


In the "value" field, enter application/json.


Now you are ready to start making queries.
An example query using the Enterprise Accounts API
This GraphQL query requests the total number of public repositories in each of your appliance's organizations using the Enterprise Accounts API. To customize this query, replace <enterprise-account-name> with the handle for your enterprise account. For example, if your enterprise account is located at https://github.com/enterprises/octo-enterprise, replace <enterprise-account-name> with octo-enterprise.
query publicRepositoriesByOrganization($slug: String!) {
  enterprise(slug: $slug) {
    ...enterpriseFragment
  }
}

fragment enterpriseFragment on Enterprise {
  ... on Enterprise{
    name
    organizations(first: 100){
      nodes{
        name
        ... on Organization{
          name
          repositories(privacy: PUBLIC){
            totalCount
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Passing our Enterprise Account as a variable
variables {
  "slug": "<enterprise-account-name>"
}

The next GraphQL query example shows how challenging it is to retrieve the number of public repositories in each organization without using the Enterprise Account API. Notice that the GraphQL Enterprise Accounts API has made this task simpler for enterprises since you only need to customize a single variable. To customize this query, replace <name-of-organization-one> and <name-of-organization-two>, etc. with the organization names on your instance.
# Each organization is queried separately
{
  organizationOneAlias: organization(login: "nameOfOrganizationOne") {
    # How to use a fragment
    ...repositories
  }
  organizationTwoAlias: organization(login: "nameOfOrganizationTwo") {
    ...repositories
  }
  # organizationThreeAlias ... and so on up-to lets say 100
}

## How to define a fragment
fragment repositories on Organization {
  name
  repositories(privacy: PUBLIC){
    totalCount
  }
}

Query each organization separately
query publicRepositoriesByOrganization {
  organizationOneAlias: organization(login: "<name-of-organization-one>") {
    # How to use a fragment
    ...repositories
  }
  organizationTwoAlias: organization(login: "<name-of-organization-two>") {
    ...repositories
  }
  # organizationThreeAlias ... and so on up-to lets say 100
}
# How to define a fragment
fragment repositories on Organization {
  name
  repositories(privacy: PUBLIC){
    totalCount
  }
}

This GraphQL query requests the last 5 log entries for an enterprise organization. To customize this query, replace <org-name> and <user-name>.
{
  organization(login: "<org-name>") {
    auditLog(last: 5, query: "actor:<user-name>") {
      edges {
        node {
          ... on AuditEntry {
# Get Audit Log Entry by 'Action'
            action
            actorLogin
            createdAt
# User 'Action' was performed on
           user{
              name
                email
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Affiliates: Personal Data may be shared with GitHub affiliates, including Microsoft, to facilitate customer service, marketing and advertising, order fulfillment, billing, technical support, and legal and compliance obligations. Our affiliates may only use the Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.
GitHub Organization Accounts: If an organization adds you to their GitHub account, we might share Personal Data with that organization to fulfill the commercial relationship. In such a case, your use of the Services is protected by a data protection agreement and terms between your organization and GitHub
Competent Authorities: We may disclose Personal Data to authorized law enforcement, regulators, courts, or other public authorities in response to lawful requests or to protect our rights and safety. Please refer to our Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data for more information.
Corporate Transaction Entities: we might disclose Personal Data within the limits of the law and in accordance with this Privacy Statement for strategic business transactions such as sales or a merger.
Partners and Resellers: We cooperate with third-parties that offer sales, consulting, support, and technical services for our Services. We may share your data with these partners and resellers where allowed, and with your consent when required.
Subprocessors and Service Providers: We may use vendors to provide services on our behalf, including hosting, marketing, advertising, social, analytics, support ticketing, credit card processing, or security services.

Private repositories: GitHub Access
If your GitHub account has private repositories, you control the access to that information. GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:

security purposes
automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
to assist the repository owner with a support matter
to maintain the integrity of the Services, or
to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.

GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.
Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)
GitHub processes Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR, ensuring a lawful basis for each processing activity. The basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. Our processing activities typically fall under these lawful bases:

Contractual Necessity: Processing is required to fulfill our contractual duties to you, in accordance with the GitHub Terms of Service.
Legal Obligation: We process data when it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, safety, and property of GitHub, our affiliates, users, or third parties.
Legitimate Interests: We process data for purposes that are in our legitimate interests, such as securing our Services, communicating with you, and improving our Services. This is done only when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Consent: We process data when you have explicitly consented to such processing. When we rely on consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent for data processing at any time. The procedures for withdrawal are detailed in this Statement and available on our website.

Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your residence location, you may have specific legal rights regarding your Personal Data:

The right to access the data collected about you
The right to request detailed information about the specific types of Personal Data we've collected over the past 12 months, including data disclosed for business purposes
The right to rectify or update inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data under certain circumstances
The right to erase or limit the processing of your Personal Data under specific conditions
The right to object to the processing of your Personal Data, as allowed by applicable law
The right to withdraw consent, where processing is based on your consent
The right to receive your collected Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format to facilitate its transfer to another company, where technically feasible

To verify your identity for security, we may request extra information before addressing your data-related request. Please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo[at]github[dot]com for any feedback or concerns. Depending on your region, you have the right to complain to your local Data Protection Authority. European users can find authority contacts on the European Data Protection Board website, and UK users on the Information Commissioner’s Office website.
We aim to promptly respond to requests in compliance with legal requirements. Please note that we may retain certain data as necessary for legal obligations or for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.
International data transfers
GitHub stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where GitHub, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where GitHub processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.
Data Privacy Framework (DPF)
GitHub also complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.
GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Dispute resolution process
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo[at]github[dot]com.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are provided at no cost to you.
An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms. For additional information visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2.
Government Enforcement
GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.
Security and Retention
GitHub uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We’ll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.

Our use of cookies and tracking technologies
Cookies and tracking technologies
GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about cookies on GitHub that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.
For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.
Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.
The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see GitHub General Privacy Statement.
What are cookies and similar technologies?
We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.
Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.
Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.
We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.
How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?
The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.
We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.
The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

























PurposeDescriptionRequired CookiesGitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.AnalyticsWe allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.Social MediaGitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.AdvertisingIn addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.
What are your cookie choices and controls?
You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:


Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages
Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.


Generally for all websites
You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:



If your browser sends a Do Not Track (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as Privacy Badger, non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as uBlock Origin, non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy
Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
United States: NAI and DAA
Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.
US State Specific Information
This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”
Privacy Rights
These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:

You can exercise this right by contacting us. You can also access and edit basic account information in your settings.
Right to Know Data Recipients: We share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see “Sharing Your Information” below.
Right to request Deletion: You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.
Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.
Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.

The GitHub Terms of Service
Effective date: November 16, 2020
A. Definitions
Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.

An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.
"Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).
The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as electronjs.org. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

B. Account Terms
Short version: Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.
1. Account Controls


Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.


Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.


2. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
3. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our Export Controls policy.

4. Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the GitHub Support portal if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

5. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.
If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
C. Acceptable Use
Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.
You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.
D. User-Generated Content
Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.
1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
2. GitHub May Remove Content
We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.
3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.
Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.
4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.
5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).
If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.
6. Contributions Under Repository License
Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.
7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.
To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
E. Private Repositories
Short version: We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.
1. Control of Private Repositories
Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.
2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories
GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
3. Access
GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.
You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.
GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.
F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.
We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.
G. Intellectual Property Notice
Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.
1. GitHub's Rights to Content
GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.
2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos
If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.
3. License to GitHub Policies
This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.
H. API Terms
Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.
Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.
You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.
You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.
GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.
I. GitHub Additional Product Terms
Short version: You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.
Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.
J. Beta Previews
Short version: Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.
1. Subject to Change
Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.
2. Confidentiality
As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.
Confidentiality Obligations. You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).
Exceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.
3. Feedback
We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.
K. Payment
Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.
1. Pricing
Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.
2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.

3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
Payment Based on Plan For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
Payment Based on Usage Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details.
Invoicing For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.
4. Authorization
By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.
5. Responsibility for Payment
You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the GitHub Support portal. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.
L. Cancellation and Termination
Short version: You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.
1. Account Cancellation
It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.
2. Upon Cancellation
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.
We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.
Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.
3. GitHub May Terminate
GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
4. Survival
All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
M. Communications with GitHub
Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.
1. Electronic Communication Required
For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.
2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing
Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.
3. No Phone Support
GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.
N. Disclaimer of Warranties
Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.
GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.
GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.
O. Limitation of Liability
Short version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.
You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
your use or inability to use the Service;
any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.
P. Release and Indemnification
Short version: You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.
If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.
Q. Changes to These Terms
Short version: We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site Policy repository.
We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.
R. Miscellaneous

You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.
2. Non-Assignability

Getting code suggestions
GitHub Copilot offers coding suggestions as you type. For example, in a Java file, create a class by typing class Test.
GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest a class body in grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press Tab.
You can also describe something you want to do using natural language within a comment, and Copilot will suggest the code to accomplish your goal. For example, type this comment in a Java file:
Java// find all images without alternate text
// and give them a red border
void process () {
// find all images without alternate text
// and give them a red border
void process () {

GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest code. To accept the suggestion, press Tab.
GitHub Copilot will attempt to match the context and style of your code. You can always edit the suggested code.
Tip

If you receive limited or no suggestions from Copilot, you may have duplication detection enabled. For more information about duplication detection, see Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber.

Showing alternative suggestions
For any given input, GitHub Copilot may offer multiple suggestions. You can select which suggestion to use, or reject all suggestions.
For example, type the following line in a Java file, and press Enter:
Javaprivate int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,

GitHub Copilot will show you a suggestion.
Now hover over the suggestion to show the GitHub Copilot control for choosing suggestions. To display next or previous suggestions, click the forward or back arrow button in the control.
You can also use keyboard shortcuts to show alternative suggestions:




















OSSee next suggestionSee previous suggestionmacOSOption+]Option+[Windows or LinuxAlt+]Alt+[
To accept a suggestion, click "Accept" in the Copilot command palette, or press Tab. To reject all suggestions, press Esc.
Showing multiple suggestions in a new tab
If you don't want to use any of the initial suggestions GitHub Copilot offers, you can show multiple suggestions in a new tab.
For example, type the following line in a Java file:
Javaprivate int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,

GitHub Copilot will show you a suggestion.
To open a new tab with multiple additional suggestions, use the following keyboard shortcut, then click Open GitHub Copilot:

















OSOpen multiple suggestionsmacOSCommand+Shift+AWindows or LinuxCtrl+Enter
To accept a suggestion, below the suggestion, click Accept suggestion NUMBER. To reject all suggestions, close the tab.
Accepting partial suggestions
If you don't want to accept an entire suggestion from GitHub Copilot, you can accept the next word or the next line of a suggestion.
For example, type the following line in a Java file:
Javaprivate int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,

GitHub Copilot will show a suggestion in grayed text. The exact suggestion may vary.
Now hover over the suggestion to show the GitHub Copilot control for choosing suggestions. To accept only the next word of the suggestion, click Accept Word in the control.
Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut to accept the next word of a suggestion:




















OSAccept Next WordAccept Next LinemacOSCommand+→Command+Control+→Windows or LinuxControl+→Control+Alt+→
If you want to accept the next line of a suggestion, you will need to set a custom keyboard shortcut for the command editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine. For more information on setting custom keyboard shortcuts, see Configuring GitHub Copilot in your environment.

For example, a question that you ask Copilot Chat, or a code snippet that you ask Copilot to complete. In addition to your prompt, Copilot uses additional context, like the code in your current file and the chat history, to generate a response.
Follow the tips in this article to write prompts that generate better responses from Copilot.
Start general, then get specific
When writing a prompt for Copilot, first give Copilot a broad description of the goal or scenario. Then list any specific requirements.
For example:

Write a function that tells me if a number is prime
The function should take an integer and return true if the integer is prime
The function should error if the input is not a positive integer

Give examples
Use examples to help Copilot understand what you want. You can provide example input data, example outputs, and example implementations.
For example:

Write a function that finds all dates in a string and returns them in an array. Dates can be formatted like:

05/02/24
05/02/2024
5/2/24
5/2/2024
05-02-24
05-02-2024
5-2-24
5-2-2024

Example:
findDates("I have a dentist appointment on 11/14/2023 and book club on 12-1-23")
Returns: ["11/14/2023", "12-1-23"]

Unit tests can also serve as examples. Before writing your function, you can use Copilot to write unit tests for the function. Then, you can ask Copilot to write a function described by those unit tests.
Break complex tasks into simpler tasks
If you want Copilot to complete a complex or large task, break the task into multiple simple, small tasks.
For example, instead of asking Copilot to generate a word search puzzle, break the process down into smaller tasks, and ask Copilot to accomplish them one by one:

Write a function to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters.
Write a function to find all words in a grid of letters, given a list of valid words.
Write a function that uses the previous functions to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters that contains at least 10 words.
Update the previous function to print the grid of letters and 10 random words from the grid.

Avoid ambiguity
Avoid ambiguous terms. For example, don’t ask "what does this do" if "this" could be the current file, the last Copilot response, or a specific code block. Instead, be specific:

What does the createUser function do?
What does the code in your last response do?

Ambiguity can also apply to libraries:

If you are using an uncommon library, describe what the library does.
If you want to use a specific library, set the import statements at the top of the file or specify what library you want to use.

Indicate relevant code
If you are using Copilot in your IDE to get suggestions as you code, open any relevant files and close irrelevant files. Copilot will use the open files to understand your request.
If you are using Copilot Chat in your IDE, open the file or highlight the code that you want Copilot to reference. You can also use keywords to manually supply context to Copilot Chat. For example, you can add the @workspace chat participant in VS Code, or @project in JetBrains IDEs. See GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet.
Experiment and iterate
If you don’t get the result that you want, iterate on your prompt and try again.
If you are using Copilot to get suggestions as you code, you can delete the suggestion entirely and start over. Or you can keep the suggestion and request modifications.
If you are using Copilot Chat, you can reference the previous response in your next request. Or, you can delete the previous response and start over.
Keep history relevant
Copilot Chat uses the chat history to get context about your request. To give Copilot only the relevant history:

Use threads to start a new conversation for a new task
Delete requests that are no longer relevant or that didn’t give you the desired result

Follow good coding practices
If you aren't getting the responses you want when you ask Copilot for suggestions or explanations in your codebase, make sure that your existing code follows best practices and is easy to read. For example:

Use a consistent code style and patterns
Use descriptive names for variables and functions
Comment your code
Structure your code into modular, scoped components
Include unit tests

Tip

Use Copilot to help your code follow best practices. For example, ask Copilot to add comments or to break a large function into smaller functions.

GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions on the GitHub website.
Copilot Chat can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of code's functionality and purpose, generating unit tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code. For more information, see Asking GitHub Copilot questions in GitHub.
On GitHub, you can use Copilot Chat to ask different questions in different contexts. For example, you can ask about a specific repository, a specific issue, or a specific pull request. You can also ask general questions about software development, or about a specific programming language.
Limitations
The quality of the results from Copilot Chat may, in some situations, be degraded if very large files, or a large number of files, are used as a context for a question.
Viewing and editing generated files within Copilot Chat
Note

This feature is currently in public preview and subject to change.

When you ask a question, Copilot may generate one or more files as part of its response. In the Copilot Chat panel, the files are displayed inline, within the chat response. In immersive view (that is, at https://github.com/copilot), the generated files are displayed in a side panel. You can view and edit the files in the panel, or download them to your computer.
For example, asking Generate a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript may generate multiple files, such as index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
In immersive view, you can also preview how some file formats, such as Markdown, render by toggling to the "Preview" tab in the side panel.
Powered by skills
When using the GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet models, Copilot has access to a collection of skills to fetch data from GitHub, which are dynamically selected based on the question you ask. You can tell which skill Copilot used by clicking  to expand the status information in the chat window.

You can explicitly ask GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub to use a particular skill - for example, Use the Bing skill to find the latest GPT4 model from OpenAI.
You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: What skills are available?
Customizing Copilot Chat responses
GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, the specifics of your project, or your personal preferences, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeating instructions in each prompt, you can create and save instructions for Copilot Chat to customize what responses you receive.
There are two types of custom instructions you can add for Copilot Chat:

Repository instructions: You can create a custom instructions file for a repository, so that all prompts asked in the context of the repository automatically include the instructions you've defined
Personal instructions: You can add personal instructions so that all the chat responses you, as a user, receive are tailored to your preferences

For more information, see Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot and Adding personal custom instructions for GitHub Copilot.
AI models for Copilot Chat
You can change the large language model that Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts, including premium models with advanced capabilities. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. For more information see Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat.
Submitting a question to Copilot Chat
You can open Copilot Chat from any page on GitHub. Certain questions may require you to be in a specific context, such as a repository, issue, or pull request. The following procedure describes how to ask a general software related question, and demonstrates the core functionality of Copilot Chat on GitHub. For more information on other scenarios, see Asking Copilot Chat questions in different contexts.
Depending on the question you ask, and your enterprise and organization settings, Copilot may respond using information based on the results of a Bing search. By using Bing search, Copilot can answer a broad range of tech-related questions with up-to-date details based on information currently available on the internet. For information on how to enable or disable Bing search integration, see Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber and Managing policies and features for Copilot in your enterprise.

Create and install a GitHub App2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent locally3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent in a codespace3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension2. Clone and start the Blackbeard agent locally3. Expose your local server4. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extensionNext stepsThe Blackbeard extension is a GitHub Copilot Extension that comprises a GitHub App and a Copilot agent. The agent responds to chat requests in the style of a pirate, using Copilot's large language model (LLM) API and special system prompts. See About Copilot agents.
This guide uses a simple agent implementation, but the process is similar for skillsets. For information about the difference between agents and skillsets, see About building Copilot Extensions.
This quickstart is designed to help you build and chat with the Blackbeard extension as quickly as possible, so you can develop and test your extension without deploying infrastructure. For production, you'll need to host the application for your agent or skillset's endpoints on a publicly accessible server. To instead learn how to create a new GitHub Copilot Extension, see Setting up Copilot Extensions.
1. Create and install a GitHub App
In the developer settings for your GitHub account, create a GitHub App. Your GitHub App must have:

A name
A homepage URL
Webhooks deselected

After you create your app, click Install App in the sidebar, then install your app on your account.
For detailed instructions, see Creating a GitHub App for your Copilot Extension.

2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent locally
Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent locally for a significantly faster build process.

Using the Terminal built into VS Code, clone the copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension repository.
In the same Terminal, run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, then run npm start to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.
In the "Ports" tab of the VS Code panel, click Forward a port or Add port, then add port 3000.
Right-click the port and set the visibility to "Public," then copy the local address.

3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension
After you set up your GitHub App and Blackbeard agent, you can integrate the agent with your app and test the Blackbeard extension. You need to make the following changes to your GitHub App settings:

In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the local address for your agent.
In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing @YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME in the Copilot Chat window, then sending a prompt as normal.
For more detailed instructions, see Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension.


2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent in a codespace
Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent in a codespace for a significantly faster build process.

Navigate to the copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension repository. Select the  Code  dropdown menu, then click Create codespace on main.
To find your new codespace, select the  Code  dropdown menu. Next to your new codespace, select , then click  Open in Browser.
In the integrated Terminal, run npm start to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.
In the "Ports" tab of the VS Code panel, click Forward a port, then add port 3000.
Right-click the port and set the visibility to "Public," then copy the local address.

3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension
After you set up your GitHub App and Blackbeard agent, you can integrate the agent with your app and test the Blackbeard extension. You need to make the following changes to your GitHub App settings:

In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the forwarded address for your agent.
In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing @YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME in the Copilot Chat window of a supported client or IDE, then sending a prompt as normal. For a list of supported clients and IDEs, see About building Copilot Extensions.
Note
 Chatting with GitHub Copilot Extensions in GitHub Codespaces is not supported.

For more detailed instructions, see Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension.


2. Clone and start the Blackbeard agent locally
Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent locally for a significantly faster build process.

Using your command line application, clone the copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension repository.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, then run npm start to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.

3. Expose your local server
To make the Blackbeard agent accessible to the Copilot platform and GitHub, you need to expose your local server so it's reachable by HTTP requests. You can use any port forwarding or tunneling service to achieve this. For the following steps, we'll use ngrok.


Navigate to ngrok's download page, then install the appropriate version of ngrok for your operating system.


Navigate to the ngrok setup and installation page, then log in or sign up for an ngrok account.


To expose your local server, in a new window of your command line application, run the following command:
Shellngrok http http://localhost:3000
ngrok http http://localhost:3000



In your command line application, next to "Forwarding," copy the URL that ngrok assigned to your server.


4. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension
To integrate your GitHub App with the Blackbeard agent, you need to make the following changes to your app settings:

In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the URL for your exposed server.
In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing @YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME in the Copilot Chat window, then sending a prompt as normal.
For more detailed instructions, see Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension.

Next steps
Now that you have a working GitHub Copilot Extension, you can try building on the Blackbeard agent to experiment with agent development.
To learn about more complex agent implementations, you can also review the following example agents and software development kit (SDK), all of which are available in the copilot-extensions organization:

GitHub Models: A more complex agent that lets you ask about and interact with various LLMs listed on the GitHub Marketplace through Copilot Chat. The GitHub Models agent makes use of function calling.
Function Calling: An example agent written in Go that demonstrates function calling and confirmation dialogs.
RAG Extension: An example agent written in Go that demonstrates a simple implementation of retrieval augmented generation.
Preview SDK: An SDK that streamlines the development of Copilot Extensions by handling request verification, payload parsing, and response formatting automatically. This SDK allows extension builders to focus more on creating core functionality and less on boilerplate code.\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions documentation Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions.
