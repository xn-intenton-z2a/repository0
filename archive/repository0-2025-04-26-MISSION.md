# Mission Statement

`repository0` is a repository template that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its
primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and provide a basis for further development, as such
we add features to showcase what we can confidently do with a single JS source file.
The source file, test file, README.md and package.json are maintained by the repository's workflows.

The mission of the contributors, human or automated, is to add handy CLI utilities in Node.js where all CLI functions are exported as JS library function.
