# Uses intentïon -agentic-lib- Feature

The **intentïon -agentic-lib-** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your 
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and 
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using 
GitHub’s -workflow_call- event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, using this
tool and the reusable workflows shall become bundled actions in due course.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows shall incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume chargeable GitHub Actions resources minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system has generated a few interesting examples (I have been educated) but nothing of personal utility.

*Warning:* This project is not yet ready for production use. You should not point the -agentic-lib- workflows a repository containing existing intellectual property.

Mixed licensing:
* This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
* This file is part of the example suite for -agentic-lib- see: https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib

* [-repository0-plot-code-lib-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0-plot-code-lib) - A CLI generating SVG and novel formats plots for formulae. 
* Send a PR to add your example, either descending from -repository0- or using the -agentic-lib- SDK directly.

## Should you use the -agentic-lib- Coding System?

* Can you access an OpenAI account with API keys that can access at least -o3-mini- ?
* Are you willing to incur charges the resources consumed by the OpenAI API and GitHub Actions ?
* Are you curious as to where self-evolving code might lead ?
* Would you like to see how such a system can be built and has been built ?
* Do you like that it's OpenAI and GitHub API calls wired together in JS (GitHub Script) and packaged as GitHub Workflows* ?
* Do you appreciate that you need -dotenv, openai, zod- in your -package.json- because the JS has dependencies on them ?

*Actions with bundled JS coming soon.

## Getting Started

Clone a seed repository which is pre-configured with the reusable workflows and scripts: https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0

### Initiating the workflow

Run the action "Create Issue" and enter some text to create an issue. This will create an issue and trigger the 
"Issue Worker" to write the code. If the Issue Worker is able to resolve the issue a Pull Request is raised, the change 
automatically merged. The issue reviewed and closed if the change is deemed to have delivered whatever was requested in the issue.

Development Workflows:
---
On timer / Manual: Create Issue (new issue opened) 
-> Issue Worker (code changed, issue updated) 
-> Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Issue Worker (code changed, issue updated) 
-> Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)
---
(Each workflow is triggered by the previous one and also on a schedule so that failures can be recovered from.)

### Tuning the agentic coding system

The default set-up is quite open which can be chaotic. To temper this chaos you can change these files which the workflow takes into consideration:
- -CONTRIBUTING.md- - The workflow is itself a contributor and will be asked to follow these guidelines. Start by writing your owm mission statement.
- -eslint.config.js- - Code style rules and additional plugins can be added here.

The following files are also taken into consideration but may also be changed (even blanked out completely) by the workflow:
- -README.md-
- -package.json-
- -src/lib/main.js-
- -tests/unit/main.test.js-

**Chain Workflows Together:**  
   Use outputs from one workflow as inputs for another. For example, if an issue review workflow outputs -fixed-, then trigger an automerge workflow based on that flag.

**Customize Parameters:**  
   Each workflow accepts parameters with sensible defaults. Override them as needed to fit your project’s structure and requirements.

**Seed and Evolve:**  
   With a simple prompt (e.g. a new issue), the system will automatically review, generate fixes using ChatGPT, commit changes, and merge them—allowing the program to evolve autonomously.

# Agentic Development System Guide

This guide explains how the various workflows of the Agentic Coding Systems work together to automate and streamline your development process. Think of these workflows as modular SDK components that encapsulate common operations—publishing, testing, issue management, dependency updates, code formatting, and more—allowing you to build an agentic development system for your projects.

---

## Issue Management Workflows
These workflows generalize the concept of work items as “tasks” rather than platform-specific issues.

### Issue Creator (-issue-creator.yml-)
- **Function:** Creates a new task based on predefined prompts.
- **Reusable Workflow:** [-wfr-create-issue.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-create-issue.yml@1.2.0)
- **Trigger:** Manual dispatch or scheduled events with input parameters.

### Issue Worker (-issue-worker.yml-)
- **Function:** Selects, validates, and initiates work on existing tasks.
- **Reusable Workflows:**
  - [-wfr-select-issue.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-select-issue.yml@1.2.0)
  - [-wfr-apply-issue-resolution.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-apply-issue-resolution.yml@1.2.0)
  - [-wfr-create-pr.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-create-pr.yml@1.2.0)

### Issue Reviewer (-issue-reviewer.yml-)
- **Function:** Reviews and finalizes tasks once work is complete.
- **Reusable Workflow:** [-wfr-review-issue.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-review-issue.yml@1.2.0)

### Automerge Workflow (-automerge.yml-)
- **Function:** Automatically merges pull requests when criteria are met.
- **Reusable Workflows:**
  - [-wfr-automerge-find-pr-from-pull-request.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-automerge-find-pr-from-pull-request.yml@1.2.0)
  - [-wfr-automerge-find-pr-in-check-suite.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-automerge-find-pr-in-check-suite.yml@1.2.0)
  - [-wfr-automerge-label-issue.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-automerge-label-issue.yml@1.2.0)
  - [-wfr-automerge-merge-pr.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-automerge-merge-pr.yml@1.2.0)

## Reusable Workflows SDK Guide

Think of each reusable workflow as a function in an SDK:
- **Inputs:** Parameters (e.g., -versionIncrement-, -buildScript-, -issueTitle-) customize workflow behavior.
- **Outputs:** Results such as task status, pull request numbers, or merge status.
- **Integration:** Invoke these workflows via GitHub Actions workflow calls, schedule triggers, or manual dispatch. They encapsulate complex operations into modular, reusable components.

### Example: Invoking the Issue Creator Workflow
---yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      issueTitle:
        description: 'Title for the new task'
        required: false
        default: 'house choice'
---
Internally, this triggers [-wfr-create-issue.yml@1.2.0-](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib/.github/workflows/wfr-create-issue.yml@1.2.0) to generate an issue template based on provided parameters.

---

## Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up your repository using the agentic development system:

features/rejects/ARG_VALIDATION.md
# features/rejects/ARG_VALIDATION.md
# ARG_VALIDATION Feature Specification

This feature refines the CLI argument parsing and validation by integrating robust libraries (yargs and zod) to ensure that only supported commands are processed and that any invalid or malformed input is clearly reported to the user.

## Overview

The updated ARG_VALIDATION feature will improve the CLI tool by:
- Replacing the basic argument handling with a structured parser using yargs.
- Defining and enforcing a validation schema with zod to allow only known commands and options.
- Providing descriptive error messages and usage hints when invalid input is detected.
- Maintaining support for all existing commands including `greet`, and preparing the CLI for future commands like `help`, `chat`, `export`, `import`, `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` as documented in other feature specs.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Integrate yargs**: Replace the current if-else branch with a yargs-based parser to handle CLI arguments in a structured manner.
- **Define a Zod Schema**: Use zod to define a schema that strictly allows commands such as `greet`, `help`, `chat`, `export`, `import`, `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update`.
- **Error Handling**: If the input does not match the schema, display a clear error message with guidance on proper usage.
- **Command Routing**: Maintain the current functionality for `greet` while setting up the framework for additional commands in the future.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **Existing Tests Update**: Update tests to account for the new argument parsing and validation behavior.
- **New Test Cases**: Add tests to simulate invalid input, ensuring that errors are properly thrown and that the user is provided with usage hints.

### README File (README.md):
- **Usage Section Update**: Document the improved argument parsing and provide examples of both valid commands (e.g., `greet`, `help`) and error cases when an unknown command is used.
- **Error Messaging**: Explain that in the event of invalid commands, the user will receive a descriptive error message advising on available commands.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No New Dependencies**: The feature uses the already included libraries (yargs and zod) to implement validation.

## Benefits

- **Improved Usability**: Users will receive immediate and clear feedback if they enter an unsupported command or malformed arguments, reducing user error.
- **Enhanced Robustness**: The CLI will process only valid input, which enhances stability and reduces unexpected behavior.
- **Extensibility**: This update provides the groundwork for future commands and features, making the CLI easier to extend and maintain.

This refined ARG_VALIDATION feature aligns with the repository's mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js, ensuring that even as new commands are added, the CLI maintains a high standard of input validation and user guidance.features/rejects/CHAT_PRIORITY.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_PRIORITY.md
# CHAT_PRIORITY Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand `chat priority` that allows users to assign a priority level to an existing chat message. The priority level helps in highlighting messages that are urgent or require special attention. The allowed levels are `high`, `medium`, and `low`.

## Overview

- **Subcommand:** `chat priority <index> <level>`
- **Functionality:**
  - Validates that the chat history file exists.
  - Parses the chat history and validates the provided message index is within bounds.
  - Checks that a priority level is supplied and that it is one of `high`, `medium`, or `low` (case-insensitive).
  - Backs up the current chat history using the existing `backupHistory` function.
  - Updates the target message by adding or updating a new property `priority` with the provided level (normalized to lowercase).
  - Saves the updated chat history back to the file and outputs a confirmation message.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new case in the main command switch to handle the `priority` subcommand:
  ```js
  case "priority":
    handlePriority(args);
    break;
  ```

- Implement the `handlePriority(args)` function with the following steps:
  - Check if the chat history file exists. If not, output an error message.
  - Parse the chat history file and validate that `args[2]` (the message index) is a valid number and within the appropriate bounds.
  - Validate that `args[3]` (the priority level) is provided and is one of `high`, `medium`, or `low`; if not, output an error message specifying the valid options.
  - Call `backupHistory(history)` to create a backup before making changes.
  - Assign the normalized (lowercase) priority level to the target message: `history.messages[index].priority = level`.
  - Write the updated history back to the file and display a message such as "Priority set for message at index X.".

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Add unit tests for the `chat priority` subcommand:
  - Test that invoking `chat priority` with a valid index and a valid priority level (e.g., "high") updates the message with the correct `priority` property.
  - Test error handling when the chat history file does not exist.
  - Test error outputs when the provided message index is invalid (non-numeric, negative, or out-of-bound).
  - Test error output when the priority level is missing or not one of the allowed values.
  - Use spies on console outputs to verify that success or error messages are correctly logged.

## README.md Updates

- Update the Chat Command documentation section by adding the following usage example:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat priority <index> <high|medium|low>
  ```
- Include a brief explanation that this command allows users to mark a message with a priority level, aiding in the organization of important or urgent messages.

## Rationale

- **Enhanced Message Management:** By assigning priority levels, users can easily flag messages that need special attention.
- **Usability:** Complements existing functions such as edit, delete, and pin by adding an extra layer of message metadata without significant complexity.
- **Mission Alignment:** This feature supports the repository’s mission of building handy CLI utilities in Node.js with minimal file modifications by extending and refining chat session functionalities.features/rejects/CHAT_DUPLICATE.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_DUPLICATE.md
# CHAT_DUPLICATE Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand `duplicate` to the chat CLI utility. When a user invokes the command with a valid message index, the feature duplicates the specified chat message by appending a new message with the same content and the current timestamp to the chat history. This capability is helpful when a user needs to resend or quickly repost an earlier message without manually retyping it.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new conditional branch under the main `chat` command for the `duplicate` subcommand.
- Validate that the chat history file exists; if not, output an appropriate error message.
- Parse and validate the provided message index (argument index 2). If the index is invalid (negative, not a number, or out-of-bounds), display an error.
- Duplicate the message at the provided index by creating a new message object with the same content and a fresh timestamp.
- Append the duplicated message to the end of the `messages` array and save the updated chat history file.
- Provide console feedback indicating successful duplication (e.g., "Message duplicated successfully.").

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat duplicate` subcommand:
  - Test that invoking the command with a valid index duplicates the message and appends it to the chat history.
  - Test behavior when the chat history file does not exist, expecting an error message.
  - Test error handling when an invalid index is provided (non-numeric, negative, or out-of-bounds).
  - Verify that the new message’s timestamp is updated to the current time and that its content matches the original message exactly.

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command section in README.md to document the new `chat duplicate` subcommand with example usage:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat duplicate <index>
  ```
- Add a brief description explaining that this command duplicates an existing message from the chat history.

## Rationale
- **Usability:** Quickly duplicate a previous message to resend it without manual re-entry.
- **Efficiency:** Leverage the existing file-based persistence model with minimal modifications to source, tests, and documentation.
- **Alignment:** Continues to build on the repository's mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js while remaining consistent with other chat management commands.
features/rejects/INTERACTIVE.md
# features/rejects/INTERACTIVE.md
# INTERACTIVE & TUTORIAL

## Overview
In addition to the existing interactive REPL and batch processing modes, this update integrates a new **tutorial sub-mode** within the INTERACTIVE feature. The tutorial mode provides a guided, step-by-step walkthrough of the CLI tool’s functionality, offering new users an engaging introduction and practical examples of available commands. This extension streamlines onboarding and empowers users to learn the tool’s capabilities quickly, in line with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration.

## CLI Integration
- **Invocation:** The tutorial mode can be activated by adding a new sub-command (e.g., `tutorial`) to the interactive flag. For example:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --interactive tutorial`
- **Mode Selection:** When the `tutorial` sub-mode is detected, the CLI will present a series of guided screens with instructions, example commands, and tips on using various sub-commands (such as arithmetic operations, configuration, and security utilities).
- **Fallback Behavior:** If users input an unknown command within the interactive session, the tutorial mode can offer contextual help and suggest usage examples.

## Implementation Details
- **Guided Walkthrough:** The tutorial will run in a text-based format, displaying instructions sequentially. It may include prompts for user input to simulate command execution and provide immediate feedback.
- **Incremental Learning:** The tutorial is structured in sections, each focusing on a set of related commands (e.g., basic math commands, configuration management, and advanced utilities) with a brief description, example commands, and expected output.
- **Integration with REPL:** Users can switch between the guided tutorial and regular REPL mode or exit the tutorial to return to standard interactive sessions.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Robust parsing of sub-commands ensures that users invoking the tutorial mode receive the proper instructional content.
- Any invalid or unsupported inputs during the tutorial sequence trigger informative error messages, directing users back to the main tutorial navigation.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate tutorial mode interactions, verifying that each tutorial screen displays the correct information and that navigation commands work as expected.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated to include examples of launching the tutorial. Inline comments in the source code explain the instructional logic and navigation flow.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By embedding an interactive tutorial within the existing INTERACTIVE feature, this update enhances user onboarding and helps maintain streamlined automation workflows. It fosters healthy collaboration by reducing the learning curve for new users and ensuring that the tool's powerful functionalities are accessible and well-documented.features/rejects/CHAT_REPLAY.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_REPLAY.md
# CHAT_REPLAY Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand, `replay`, to the chat CLI utility. The `chat replay` command reads the stored chat history and re-displays each message in sequence. This allows users to review past interactions in the order they occurred.

## Overview
- **Subcommand:** `chat replay`
- **Functionality:** Reads the `.chat_history.json` file (if present) and prints each message to the console one by one in the order they were recorded. If no chat history exists, a suitable informational message is shown.
- **Purpose:** Helps users quickly review the conversation flow without manually searching through the history.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new conditional branch for the `replay` subcommand under the main `chat` command.
- Check if the chat history file exists. If not, output "No chat history available for replay.".
- If the file exists, parse the chat history and iterate over the messages array.
- For each message, print its timestamp and content in a readable format.
- Ensure that error handling is in place in case of file access or parsing errors.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the following scenarios:
  - When the `chat replay` command is executed and no chat history exists, confirm that the output indicates the absence of history.
  - When chat history exists, verify that invoking `chat replay` outputs all messages in the correct order. Use spies on console.log to capture the output.
  - Include tests for verifying the formatting of each replayed message (e.g., timestamp and message content are present).

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command section to document the new `chat replay` subcommand. Example usage:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat replay
  ```
- Add a brief explanation that this command replays the chat history, displaying each message in order.

## Rationale
- **Enhanced Usability:** Allows users to review the conversation context easily without manually inspecting the JSON history.
- **Consistency:** Complements existing chat functionalities (stats, undo, filter, edit, clear) by addressing the review stage of the conversation.
- **Simplicity:** Implements replay functionality with minimal changes to the existing single source file structure.

## Implementation Considerations
- Ensure that the new branch in the source file does not conflict with other subcommands.
- Maintain clear and consistent error handling for non-existent history files and JSON parsing issues.
- Follow existing code style and documentation standards as per CONTRIBUTING.md.
features/rejects/CHAT_EDIT.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_EDIT.md
# CHAT_EDIT Feature

This feature introduces an "edit" subcommand to the chat CLI. It allows users to modify an existing chat message in the persistent chat history file (`.chat_history.json`). This update enhances usability by letting users correct mistakes or update information in a previously recorded message.

## Overview

- **Subcommand**: `chat edit <index> <new message>`
- **Functionality**: Updates the message at the specified zero-based index in the chat history with the new message content. If the index is out of bounds, or if no history exists, the command will output an error message.
- **Target Files**: The update modifies the source file (`src/lib/main.js`), test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), and README (`README.md`).

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new branch to handle the `edit` subcommand when the first argument is `chat` and the second is `edit`.
- Validate that the index (argument index 2) and the new message (argument index 3 and beyond) are provided. If missing, output an error message with usage instructions.
- Check that the chat history file (`.chat_history.json`) exists. If it does not, notify the user that there is no chat history available.
- Parse the chat history file and verify that the given index is within the range of the existing messages. If the index is valid, update the corresponding message's content with the new message and update its timestamp to the current time. If the index is invalid, output an error message.
- Write the updated chat history back to the file and notify the user of a successful update.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Add unit tests for the following scenarios:
  - When the `edit` subcommand is run without sufficient arguments, expect an appropriate error message.
  - When the chat history file does not exist, verify that the command outputs a message indicating no available chat history.
  - When an invalid index is provided (e.g., out of range), verify that the command outputs an error message indicating the issue.
  - When a valid index and new message are provided, verify that the chat message is updated and the change is persisted in the history file.

## README.md Updates

- Document the new `chat edit` subcommand in the Chat Command section, including usage examples and a brief explanation:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat edit <index> <new message>
  ```
  This command updates the existing chat message at the given index with the new message content.

## Rationale

- Improves the usability of the chat CLI by allowing users to correct or update earlier messages without starting a new chat session.
- Keeps all chat record modifications within the same persistent file, ensuring consistency with the repository’s design and the mission to provide handy CLI utilities.
- The feature maintains code simplicity by only modifying the necessary files (source, tests, README) without adding any new files or complex dependencies.

features/rejects/EXTENSIONS.md
# features/rejects/EXTENSIONS.md
# EXTENSIONS

## Overview
This feature consolidates two auxiliary CLI enhancements into one unified extension module. It merges dynamic plugin loading (formerly provided by the PLUGIN_SYSTEM feature) with shell auto-completion support (formerly provided by the SHELL_COMPLETION feature). This integrated approach not only reduces redundancy by fitting within the 15-feature limit but also enriches the CLI tool by offering customizable functionality extensions and improved user experience through command auto-completion.

## Plugin Integration
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:**
  - The CLI checks for a `plugins/` directory at startup and dynamically imports any `.js` files found there.
  - Each plugin must export a command identifier and a handler function, which are then seamlessly integrated into the CLI command mapping.
  - Loading errors or improperly structured plugins generate warnings without stopping execution.

## Shell Auto-Completion
- **Auto-Generation of Completion Scripts:**
  - A new global flag (e.g., `--completion`) lets users generate auto-completion scripts for popular shells such as Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
  - The CLI dynamically reads its internal command mapping, including all aliases, to produce a tailored completion script based on the user’s shell type.
  - Clear error messages are issued if an unsupported shell is detected or if the user does not provide a valid shell parameter.

## Integration and Benefits
- Consolidates two related extensions into one module to streamline the project and stay under the maximum feature limit.
- Enhances overall CLI usability by enabling both custom plugin support and shell auto-completion, reducing setup overhead for end users.
- Supports healthy collaboration through extensibility and improved productivity, in line with the repository’s mission.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate plugin loading from a temporary directory and validate correct generation of shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples:
  - Plugin example: Place JavaScript modules in the `plugins/` directory to add custom commands.
  - Completion example: `node src/lib/main.js --completion bash > repository_completion.sh`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging dynamic plugin integration and shell auto-completion into a single EXTENSIONS module, this feature reinforces our commitment to modular, self-contained, and user-friendly CLI utilities. This consolidation supports streamlined automation and healthy collaboration while keeping the repository's feature set within ideal limits.features/rejects/CHAT_REPLY.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_REPLY.md
# CHAT_REPLY Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand, `chat reply`, to the CLI chat utility. Users can now reply to an existing chat message without quoting it explicitly. Instead, the reply is linked to the original message using a `replyTo` property in the message object.

## Overview

- **Subcommand:** `chat reply <index> <message>`
- **Functionality:**
  - Validates that the chat history exists and that the specified message index is valid.
  - Checks that a reply message is provided.
  - Creates a new chat message which contains the provided reply text and includes a `replyTo` property that references the index of the original message being replied to.
  - Appends the new reply message to the chat history with the current timestamp.
  - Saves the updated chat history to the persistent file (`.chat_history.json`).

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new conditional branch in the main command handler for the `reply` subcommand. For example:
  ```js
  case "reply":
    handleReply(args);
    break;
  ```
- Implement the `handleReply(args)` function which will:
  - Check if the chat history file exists; if not, output an error message.
  - Parse the chat history and validate the provided index (argument index 2). If the index is invalid (negative or out-of-bounds), display an error.
  - Ensure the reply message (arguments from index 3 and beyond) is provided; if not, show a usage error.
  - Optionally call `backupHistory(history)` to allow undo functionality before modifying the history.
  - Create a new message object with the following structure:
    - `timestamp`: Set to the current date/time in ISO format.
    - `message`: The reply text provided by the user.
    - `replyTo`: The index (or a copy of the original message reference) of the message being replied to.
  - Append the new reply message to the `history.messages` array and write back to the file.
  - Provide console feedback confirming that the reply has been added successfully.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Add unit tests for the `chat reply` subcommand covering:
  - **Valid Reply:** Test that invoking `chat reply` with a valid index and a reply message appends a new message with a `replyTo` property that matches the original index.
  - **Invalid Index:** Ensure that using an invalid message index results in an appropriate error message.
  - **Missing Reply Message:** Check that if the reply message is missing, the command outputs an error message.

features/rejects/CHAT_SUMMARY.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_SUMMARY.md
# CHAT_SUMMARY Feature

This feature introduces the `chat summary` subcommand to the chat CLI utility. Unlike `chat stats` which provides numerical metrics, the `chat summary` command offers a concise textual recap of a chat session. It extracts key points from the conversation to narratively summarize the session.

## Overview

- **Subcommand:** `chat summary`
- **Functionality:** Reads the persistent chat history from `.chat_history.json` and produces a short, textual summary. The summary includes the session title, the first and last messages as representative anchors, and the total number of messages exchanged. In cases where the chat history is missing or empty, an appropriate message is displayed.
- **Purpose:** Enables users to quickly grasp the context and evolution of their conversation without reviewing every message, complementing the numeric details provided by `chat stats`.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new branch to handle the `chat summary` subcommand under the main `chat` command.
- Check if the chat history file exists. If it does not, output "No chat history available for summary.".
- If the file exists, parse the JSON data:
  - If there are no messages, display "Chat history is empty. No summary available.".
  - If messages exist, extract the first and last messages and compute the total count.
  - Construct a summary text in the following format:
    - "Session '<sessionTitle>' started with: '<first message>' and ended with: '<last message>'. A total of <number> messages were exchanged."
- Print the generated summary to the console.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Add unit tests to cover:
  - Invoking `chat summary` when no chat history file exists: Expect output "No chat history available for summary.".
  - Invoking `chat summary` when the chat history exists but contains no messages: Expect output indicating that no summary is available.
  - Invoking `chat summary` when the chat history contains messages: Verify that the output includes the correct session title, first message, last message, and total message count.

## README.md Updates

- Update the documentation in the Chat Command section to include an explanation and usage example for the new `chat summary` subcommand.
- Example usage:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat summary
  ```
- Document that this command provides a textual recap of the entire chat session.

## Rationale

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides users with an accessible overview of their conversation, simplifying long chat histories.
- **Complementary Functionality:** Works in tandem with existing features such as `chat stats` and `chat replay`, rounding out the suite of chat management tools.
- **Mission Alignment:** Realizes the repository's mission to offer handy and compact CLI utilities in Node.js by summarizing multi-turn conversations in a concise way.
features/rejects/CHAT_SEARCH.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_SEARCH.md
# CHAT_SEARCH Feature

## Overview
This feature adds a new subcommand `search` under the `chat` command. It enables users to search through their stored chat history for messages that contain a specified keyword. The search is performed case-insensitively and displays matching messages along with their timestamps.

## Implementation Details
- Update the source file (`src/lib/main.js`) to include a new branch for handling `chat search <keyword>` command.
- When the `search` subcommand is invoked, the program should:
  - Check for the existence of the chat history file (`.chat_history.json`).
  - Load the chat history, and if it exists, filter the messages based on the provided keyword (case-insensitive match).
  - Display the matching messages in a clear, human-readable format, including message timestamps.
  - If the chat history file does not exist or no messages match the search query, display an informative message to the user.
- Ensure that the new functionality integrates seamlessly with the existing chat commands such as session management and export.

## Testing
- Modify the unit test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`) to add tests for the following scenarios:
  - The chat history exists and contains messages matching the keyword.
  - The chat history exists but no messages match the provided keyword.
  - The chat history file does not exist.
- Validate that the output is formatted correctly and includes relevant information such as timestamps for matching messages.

## Documentation
- Update the `README.md` file to document the new `chat search` command with usage examples, e.g.,
  ```sh
  node src/lib/main.js chat search <keyword>
  ```

This enhancement furthers the repository's mission of providing valuable and handy CLI utilities by allowing users to efficiently filter and review their chat history.features/rejects/CHAT.md
# features/rejects/CHAT.md
# CHAT

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CHAT feature by maintaining an optional conversation context. In addition to the current functionality that sends a single query to the Chat Completions API and displays immediate responses, the feature now supports a multi-turn conversational mode. Users can choose to engage in an interactive session where past messages are preserved and sent along with new queries, yielding more contextually accurate responses.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Addition:** The `--chat` CLI flag remains available. A new optional flag `--context` can be provided to enable conversation mode. When `--context` is active, the session will maintain a conversation history in memory.
- **Interactive Mode:** In context mode, after the initial query is processed, the CLI remains open for further input, displaying a prompt (e.g., `chat>`) for subsequent queries. Users can type new messages which will be appended to the conversation history.
- **Session Termination:** Typing an exit command (such as `exit` or `quit`) will end the conversation and clear the history.

## API Interaction
- **Single Query Mode:** As before, when no conversation context is supplied, the command sends a standalone query to the Chat Completions API, reading the API key from the environment variable `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` and formatting the response appropriately (plain text or JSON with metadata).
- **Contextual Request Handling:** In conversation mode, the API call now includes an array of message objects representing the conversation history along with the latest query. This ensures that responses are generated with awareness of prior exchanges.
- **Response Formatting:** The response is displayed in plain text or JSON, including additional metadata (timestamp, execution duration) in JSON mode. The conversation mode also echoes the previous conversation to help users track context.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:** The command validates that a non-empty query is provided. If no query is given, a standardized error message is output.
- **API Errors:** Network issues or invalid API keys are caught and reported with clear error messages. When in conversation mode, if an error occurs, the session will prompt the user to either fix the issue or exit.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests simulate multi-turn interactions and verify that conversation history is maintained and correctly passed to the API. Both valid and error responses in context mode are tested.
- **Documentation:** Update the README to include usage examples, such as:
  - Single Query Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --chat "What is the weather today?"`
  - Conversation Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --chat --context "Tell me a joke"`, followed by additional inputs at the prompt.
- **Inline Comments:** In `src/lib/main.js`, comments explain the new conversation logic and how the conversation history is managed.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enabling a conversational context, this update enriches the CHAT feature to support interactive, multi-turn dialogues. This improvement promotes a more engaging user experience while reinforcing the mission of healthy collaboration and streamlined automation in a modular, single-file utility.
features/rejects/CHAT_FILTER.md

This addition provides enhanced usability by quickly identifying relevant parts of a chat session, aligning with our mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js.

## Overview

- **Subcommand**: `chat filter <keyword>`
- **Functionality**: Searches the conversation history for messages containing the specified keyword and displays them. If no keyword is provided or no matches are found, appropriate messages are displayed.
- **Target Files**: The update modifies the source file (`src/lib/main.js`), test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), and README (`README.md`).

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new conditional branch under the 'chat' command to handle the `filter` subcommand.
- Validate that the keyword (argument index 2) is provided; if not, output an error message guiding the user.
- Load and parse the `.chat_history.json` file if it exists. If the file does not exist, notify the user that there is no chat history available.
- Filter the messages in the chat history that include the specified keyword (case-insensitive search).
- Display the filtered messages. If no messages match, display a message stating that no matches were found.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Add unit tests for the following scenarios:
  - When the `filter` subcommand is run without a keyword, expect an appropriate error message.
  - When the chat history file does not exist, ensure the command outputs the message indicating no available history.
  - When the chat history exists and contains messages matching the keyword, verify that the correct messages are displayed.
  - When the chat history exists but no messages match the keyword, verify that a "no matches found" message is output.

## README.md Updates

- Document the new `chat filter` subcommand in the Chat Command section, including usage examples:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat filter <keyword>
  ```

# features/rejects/CHAT_STATS.md
# CHAT_STATS Enhancement

This update refines the existing CHAT_STATS functionality to provide deeper insights into a chat session beyond just the total number of messages. It introduces additional computed metrics such as the first and last message timestamps, the overall session duration, and the minimum and maximum time intervals between consecutive messages.

## Overview

- **Enhanced Metrics:**
  - **First Message Timestamp:** Display the timestamp of the first recorded message.
  - **Last Message Timestamp:** Display the timestamp of the most recent message.
  - **Total Duration:** Compute the duration between the first and last message (when there is more than one message).
  - **Interval Analysis:** Calculate and display the minimum and maximum time intervals between consecutive messages.
  - When there is only one message or if any timestamps are missing/invalid, these extra metrics are omitted and an informational note is provided.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Update the `handleStats` function:
  - If the chat history file exists, parse the data and retrieve the session title and message array.
  - Extract the timestamp of the first and last messages from the list.
  - If there are at least two messages, compute the duration (difference between first and last timestamps) and iterate over the messages to compute the intervals between consecutive messages. Determine the minimum and maximum intervals.
  - Display the session title, total number of messages, first and last message timestamps, total duration, and the computed intervals.
  - Add robust error handling for missing data or invalid timestamps.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Extend the tests for the `chat stats` subcommand:
  - Verify that when multiple messages with valid timestamps are present, all enhanced metrics (first and last timestamps, total duration, minimum and maximum intervals) are correctly computed and displayed.
  - Add tests for edge cases with a single message and incomplete or invalid timestamp data, ensuring that extra metrics are omitted and a proper note is output.

## README.md Updates

- Update the Chat Command documentation to include details of these enhanced statistics.
  - Provide usage examples such as:
    ```
    node src/lib/main.js chat stats
    ```
  - Document that if additional data is available, the summary will list the first and last message timestamps, total duration, and the min/max intervals.

## Rationale

- **Enhanced Analytics:** Users get a more comprehensive snapshot of their chat session dynamics by having access to extra timing metrics.
- **Improved User Experience:** Quickly determine the flow of conversation with clear and actionable insights on the session’s timing details.
- **Mission Alignment:** This enhancement continues our mission of delivering handy CLI utilities in a minimalistic Node.js utility, refining existing functionality without unwanted complexity.features/rejects/CHAT_HISTORY.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_HISTORY.md
# Overview
This feature enhances the existing chat command by adding a "history" subcommand. When invoked, the chat history is read from the persistent file and displayed in a human-readable summary format on the console. This improves usability by allowing users to quickly review past chat messages without needing to export them to a separate file.

# Implementation Details
- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) to include a new branch for the "chat history" command (i.e., when `args[0]` is "chat" and `args[1]` is "history").
- Read the existing chat history from `.chat_history.json`. If the file exists, format and print the session title and a list of messages including their timestamps.
- If the file does not exist or fails to load, display an appropriate message indicating that there is no chat history available.
- Maintain compatibility with the current CLI structure and ensure minimal changes to existing functionality.

# Testing
- Update the unit test file (tests/unit/main.test.js) to add tests that validate the new output for the "chat history" command.
- Test cases should include scenarios where the chat history exists and where it does not, ensuring proper formatting and error handling.

# Documentation
- Update the README file to document the new "chat history" command. Include usage examples, such as:
  ```sh
  node src/lib/main.js chat history
  ```

# Dependencies
- This feature only modifies the source code, tests, and documentation. No additional dependencies are required.

# Conclusion
This enhancement brings added value by providing immediate feedback on past conversations, aligning with the repository's mission of offering handy CLI utilities in Node.js.features/rejects/FILE_WATCHER.md
# features/rejects/FILE_WATCHER.md
# FILE_WATCHER

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight file watcher for developers working on repository0. By adding a new CLI flag (`--watch-files`), the repository will monitor key directories (such as `src/` and `tests/`) for changes. When changes are detected, the watcher can automatically trigger actions like re-running tests or notifying the user, thereby improving the development feedback loop and supporting continuous integration and development practices.

## Implementation Details
- **File Monitoring:** Leverage Node.js's built-in `fs.watch` API to monitor changes in designated directories (e.g., `src/` and `tests/`).
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI flag (`--watch-files`) in the main execution file (`src/lib/main.js`). When this flag is provided, the application should initialize the file watcher after processing other CLI arguments.
- **Event Handling:** On file modification, the system should either trigger an automated test run (by invoking a child process that runs tests) or log a message to notify developers. Ensure that the watcher handles common edge cases (e.g., temporary file changes, rapid changes) gracefully.
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate the file watching logic in a single module (e.g., `src/lib/fileWatcher.js`) to keep it self-contained and maintainable.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Implement tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/fileWatcher.test.js`) to simulate file changes and verify that the appropriate events are emitted and handled.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure that the watcher does not consume excessive resources and handles cases such as file deletion or rapid successive changes without crashing.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include a section on the file watcher feature. Provide usage examples, such as:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --watch-files
  ```
- Document how the file watcher works, what directories are monitored by default, and how users can configure or extend the functionality if needed.

This feature supports the repository’s mission by fostering an efficient development environment and facilitating automated feedback, which is essential for maintaining robust CI/CD workflows.features/rejects/CHAT_PIN.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_PIN.md
# CHAT_PIN Feature

This feature introduces two new subcommands, `pin` and `unpin`, to the chat CLI utility. These commands allow users to mark a specific chat message as important (pinned) for quick reference and later remove the pinned status if needed. This enhancement builds on the existing chat functionality and extends the capabilities for managing conversation history.

## Overview

- **Subcommands:**
  - `chat pin <index>`: Marks the chat message at the given index as pinned by adding a `pinned: true` property.
  - `chat unpin <index>`: Removes the pinned status from the chat message at the given index.

- **Behavior:**
  - When the `pin` command is invoked, the application first validates that the chat history file exists, then parses the list of messages. If the provided index is valid, it sets a new property `pinned` to `true` on that message and saves the updated file. If the index is invalid or the file does not exist, an appropriate error message is displayed.
  - The `unpin` command follows a similar flow: validate, parse, check index, and either remove or set the `pinned` property to `false` for the specified message.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new conditional branch under the `chat` command to handle the `pin` and `unpin` subcommands.
- For `chat pin <index>`:
  - Verify that the chat history file exists; if not, output an error.
  - Parse the provided index from the command arguments and check its validity against the messages array.
  - If valid, set `history.messages[index].pinned = true` and write the updated history back to the file. Confirm the action to the user.
- For `chat unpin <index>`:
  - Follow similar steps, removing the `pinned` flag (or setting it to `false`) if the index is valid.
- Ensure robust error handling in scenarios where the file is missing, the index is invalid, or read/write operations fail.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Add unit tests for both `chat pin` and `chat unpin` subcommands. Tests should cover:
  - Successful pinning and unpinning of a message at a valid index.
  - Error handling when an invalid index is provided (e.g., negative or out of bounds).
  - Cases where the chat history file does not exist, ensuring the appropriate error is output.
  - Verification that the `pinned` property is correctly set or removed in the chat history file.

## README.md Updates

- Update the Chat Command documentation in README.md to include usage examples for the new subcommands:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat pin <index>
  node src/lib/main.js chat unpin <index>
  ```
- Provide a brief description of the feature, emphasizing how pinning helps identify and manage important messages within a chat session.

## Rationale

- **Enhanced Usability:** This feature allows users to quickly flag important messages, making it easier to reference key parts of a conversation.
- **Consistency:** It complements other chat management commands (such as edit, delete, and export) while maintaining the simplicity and file-based persistence model.
- **Mission Alignment:** By improving message management, the feature supports the repository’s mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js with minimalistic yet effective enhancements.
features/rejects/CONFIG.md
# features/rejects/CONFIG.md
# CONFIG

## Overview
This feature introduces a centralized configuration management system for repository0. It is designed to load, validate, and manage environment variables and other configuration settings using a simple, consistent API. By leveraging tools such as dotenv and zod, the CONFIG module ensures that all required settings are present and valid, thus supporting robust CI/CD workflows and healthy collaboration.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Loading:**
  - Use the dotenv library to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring that configuration values are initialized before other modules are executed.
  - Provide support for default values, allowing the system to fall back on sensible defaults if certain variables are not defined.

- **Validation:**
  - Integrate zod for schema validation to verify that the loaded configuration adheres to expected types and constraints.
  - If configuration validation fails, the module should exit gracefully with a clear error message and appropriate exit code (as defined in the EXIT_CODES feature).

- **API Design:**
  - Expose a simple, unified API that lets other parts of the application retrieve configuration values.
  - Enable runtime reloading or refreshing of configuration if needed, supporting dynamic changes without restarting the application where possible.

- **Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to initialize the CONFIG module early in the startup process.
  - Ensure that other features such as HTTP_API, LOGGING, and NUMERIC_SAFE can access configuration data using the provided API.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/config.test.js`) to simulate loading of environment variables, validate schema correctness, and verify that default values are applied appropriately.
  - Test edge cases where the `.env` file is missing or contains invalid values.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING:**
  - Update documentation to include instructions on how to use and extend the configuration management module.
  - Provide usage examples and guidelines for setting up the `.env` file with required values.
  - Document how the CONFIG module interacts with other features and its role in supporting the repository’s mission.
features/rejects/LOGGING.md
# features/rejects/LOGGING.md
# Overview
This feature consolidates file-based logging, log rotation, configurable log levels, and automated log cleanup into a unified logging module. In this update, we are enhancing the existing functionality with structured JSON logging output to better integrate with external logging systems and automated monitoring tools.

# Implementation Details
- **File Logging & Rotation:**
  - Activate logging via a CLI flag (e.g. `--log-file <filename>`) to write timestamped log entries in a human-readable format.
  - Implement log rotation so that when a specified file size threshold is reached (configurable via an environment variable), the current log file is archived (renamed with a timestamp or incremental index) and a new log file is started.
  - Support activation via an additional CLI flag (e.g. `--enable-log-rotation`) or through environment configuration.

- **Configurable Log Levels:**
  - Provide a `--log-level <level>` flag where `<level>` can be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR. Ensure that log output respects the configured level for both console and file outputs.

- **Structured JSON Logging:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--json-logs`) that, when enabled, outputs log entries in a structured JSON format. This format will include keys such as timestamp, level, message, and an optional context object.
  - Allow simultaneous support for both plain text and JSON output modes to accommodate various use scenarios (development vs. automated monitoring).

- **Automated Log Cleanup Integration:**
  - Merge log cleanup responsibilities into the unified logging module. Introduce a CLI flag (e.g. `--cleanup-logs`) that triggers a routine to scan the designated log directory for rotated log files.
  - The cleanup process will apply configurable criteria based on maximum file age (e.g. older than 7 days) or a maximum number of log files to retain, with settings provided via environment variables (e.g. `LOG_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE`, `LOG_CLEANUP_MAX_FILES`).

- **Error Handling & Fallback:**
  - Encapsulate all logging functionality in a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/logging.js`) so that any file operation errors or issues with JSON formatting do not interrupt the primary CLI workflow. Fallback to console logging if file-based operations fail.

# Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to confirm that log entries are correctly formatted in both plain text and JSON modes. Simulate scenarios where file rotation should occur, verifying that old log files are archived according to the size threshold.
  - Test the cleanup routine to ensure it deletes expired log files based on age or number limits.
  - Validate that the `--json-logs` flag correctly toggles structured output and that the logs include all intended meta-data (timestamp, level, message, context).

# Documentation
- **Usage Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Activate file logging with rotation and JSON structured logs
  node src/lib/main.js --log-file app.log --enable-log-rotation --log-level INFO --json-logs

  # Run the application and trigger log cleanup
  node src/lib/main.js --cleanup-logs
  ```
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include usage instructions for all logging-related CLI flags (`--log-file`, `--enable-log-rotation`, `--log-level`, `--json-logs`, and `--cleanup-logs`) along with examples and troubleshooting tips.

# Benefits
- **Unified Logging Management:** Combines logging, rotation, cleanup, and structured JSON output into one maintainable module, reducing redundancy.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Provides clear logging output with automatic cleanup and enables integration with external logging aggregators and monitoring systems.
- **User Flexibility:** Offers configurable options that allow users to tailor logging behavior to their project’s needs, ensuring both human-readable and machine-consumable outputs.
features/rejects/CLI_COMMANDS.md
# features/rejects/CLI_COMMANDS.md
# CLI_COMMANDS Feature Update

This update enhances the CLI tool by fully implementing the command routing for the "version" and "update" commands as documented in the existing CLI_COMMANDS feature specification. This update ensures that when a user invokes the CLI with these commands, they receive clear and appropriate responses.

## Overview

The CLI tool currently supports a few commands (greet, gcd, lcm, prime, diagnostics) while unknown commands result in an error message. This feature extends the command routing logic by adding support for:

- **version**: Outputs a message with the current repository version (e.g., "Version: 1.4.1-13").
- **update**: Simulates an update check by printing a message such as "Checking for updates... No updates available".

By adding these commands, the CLI becomes consistent with the documentation and package.json scripts, thereby enhancing the user experience and aligning with the repository's mission to provide handy Node.js CLI utilities.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Command Detection:** Extend the existing command routing logic in the main function to detect the "version" and "update" commands.
- **Version Command:** When the first argument is "version", output the version string. Example:
  ```js
  if (command === "version") {
    console.log("Version: 1.4.1-13");
  }
  ```
- **Update Command:** When the first argument is "update", output a simulated update check message. Example:
  ```js
  else if (command === "update") {
    console.log("Checking for updates... No updates available");
  }
  ```
- Ensure that these new branches integrate seamlessly with the existing routing and error handling logic.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Cases:** Add tests to simulate invoking the CLI with the "version" and "update" commands. Verify that the correct messages are printed.
- Example test case for version:
  ```js
  test("should output correct version", () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation(() => {});
    main(["version"]);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Version: 1.4.1-13");
    spy.mockRestore();
  });
  ```
- Example test case for update:
  ```js
  test("should output update message", () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation(() => {});
    main(["update"]);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Checking for updates... No updates available");
    spy.mockRestore();
  });
  ```

### README File (README.md):
- **Documentation Update:** Add examples in the CLI usage section to demonstrate invoking the "version" and "update" commands.
- Ensure the README reflects that these commands are now supported and explain their outputs.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No Additional Dependencies:** The feature uses existing dependencies. Confirm that the scripts for "version" and "check-update" in package.json remain consistent with the new command implementations.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Functionality:** Users receive immediate, clear output for version and update checks, providing a more complete CLI experience.
- **Improved Consistency:** Aligns the behavior of the CLI tool with the documented features and package.json scripts.
- **User Confidence:** Clear command responses help users understand the state of the application, contributing to a better overall user experience.

# DRY_RUN

## Overview
This feature introduces a dry-run mode to the CLI tool. When enabled via a new global flag (`--dry-run`), the tool simulates the execution of any command without performing side effects, logging, or invoking external processes. This mode is particularly useful for debugging, testing scripts, and verifying command inputs without modifying state or triggering actions like HTTP calls or file logging.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global flag `--dry-run` that can be used in combination with any other command.
- **Behavior:** When `--dry-run` is active, the CLI will parse and validate command inputs, then produce a structured output indicating what would be executed, including all computed results, potential warnings, and metadata. No external side effects (e.g., file logging, scheduled command execution, HTTP API calls) will occur.
- **Output:** In dry-run mode, the tool will output all computed values and actions in both plain text and JSON modes, mirroring the normal execution output while explicitly stating that this is a simulated run.

## Implementation Details
- **Input Parsing:** The existing input parsing logic is reused. Before invoking the command handler, the tool checks if `--dry-run` is set. If so, it routes the command through a simulation wrapper.
- **Simulation Wrapper:** Each command’s handler is wrapped so that it collects the intended actions and computed results without executing side effects. For example, scheduled executions in TIMER or external API calls in HTTP_API are bypassed with a warning message indicating that these actions would have been executed in a normal run.
- **Diagnostic Output:** The dry-run output includes detailed metadata such as timestamp, version, execution duration (simulated), input echo, and a special flag indicating that the command was not executed for real.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Consistent Reporting:** Validation and error handling are performed as usual, ensuring that users receive the same warnings and errors. However, any operation that would trigger state changes or side effects is instead logged as a simulated action.
- **Fallback:** If a command inherently requires state changes that cannot be simulated, the tool will report this limitation while still processing the remainder of the input.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests should simulate dry-run invocations across different commands (e.g., arithmetic operations, configuration queries, and scheduling commands) to ensure the output correctly indicates a dry-run. Tests must also verify that no external systems are affected during simulation.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples demonstrating dry-run usage:
  - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --dry-run --sum 3 4 5`
  - Document that dry-run mode is meant for testing and validation and does not perform any irreversible actions.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The DRY_RUN feature aligns with the repository’s mission by enhancing the modular, self-contained CLI utility’s usability and safety. By allowing users to simulate command execution, the tool promotes healthy collaboration and reduces risk during development and automation workflows.features/rejects/NOTES_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/NOTES_MANAGER.md
# NOTES_MANAGER

## Overview
The NOTES_MANAGER feature provides a lightweight note‐taking utility that enables users to quickly save, retrieve, update, delete, and now search personal notes stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`). This updated version adds searchable functionality by allowing users to filter notes based on keywords, matching either the note title or its content. This enhancement fosters better organization and recall of important information, aligning with the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined, self-contained utilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Use the global flag `--notes` to activate the notes management module.
- **Sub-Commands:**
  - **add <title> <content>:** Save a new note with a title and content. Optionally, support a comma-separated list of tags appended to the content.
  - **list:** Display a list of note titles with their creation timestamps.
  - **get <title>:** Retrieve and display full details (title, content, creation date, last modified date) of a note by its title.
  - **update <title> <new_content>:** Modify the content (and optionally tags) of an existing note.
  - **remove <title>:** Delete a note by its title.
  - **search <query>:** Search all notes for the provided keyword. The search examines both titles and content, returning any notes that match the query.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Storage:** Notes are stored in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`), with each note record including metadata such as title, content, creation timestamp, and last modified timestamp. Optionally, notes may store a list of tags to facilitate categorization.
- **Input Parsing & Validation:** The CLI parser processes sub-commands and validates that required parameters (e.g., note title and content) are provided. For the search command, it ensures a non-empty query is passed.
- **Search Logic:** The search function reads all stored notes and performs case-insensitive matching against the title and content. Matching notes are returned with brief metadata to assist users in quickly finding their desired notes.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages are provided if a note is not found (for get, update, or remove) or if required parameters are missing. File I/O errors are handled gracefully with appropriate error notifications.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to cover all sub-commands including the new search functionality. Tests should verify that notes are properly added, retrieved, updated, deleted, and that search queries return accurate results.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides to include examples such as:
  - Adding a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes add "Meeting" "Discuss project updates, tags:meeting,project"`
  - Listing notes: `node src/lib/main.js --notes list`
  - Retrieving a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes get "Meeting"`
  - Updating a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes update "Meeting" "Discuss timeline and next steps, tags:timeline"`
  - Removing a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes remove "Meeting"`
  - Searching notes: `node src/lib/main.js --notes search "project"`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enabling users to quickly search their notes, the updated NOTES_MANAGER enhances productivity and ease-of-access. This improvement supports agile workflows and fosters healthy collaboration by ensuring that critical documentation and reminders are readily accessible within a single, self-contained CLI tool.features/rejects/CHAT_SCHEDULE.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_SCHEDULE.md
# CHAT_SCHEDULE Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand, `chat schedule`, to the chat CLI utility. It allows users to schedule a message to be appended to the chat history after a specified delay in seconds. This enhancement adds a time-dependent messaging capability, enabling users to plan future contributions to a chat session.

## Overview
- **Subcommand:** `chat schedule <delay_in_seconds> <message>`
- **Functionality:**
  - Validates that the chat history file exists and the delay parameter is a valid positive integer.
  - Uses a timer (via `setTimeout`) to wait for the specified delay, then appends the scheduled message to the chat history.
  - Before appending the new message, the current state is backed up using `backupHistory` to support undo functionality.
  - The new message is appended with the current timestamp once the delay elapses.
  - Provides console feedback indicating that the message is scheduled and notifies when the scheduled message is added.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new branch in the main command handler for the `schedule` subcommand. For example:
  ```js
  case "schedule":
    handleSchedule(args);
    break;
  ```
- Implement the `handleSchedule(args)` function:
  - Verify that the chat history file exists; if not, output an error message.
  - Parse `args[2]` as the delay in seconds. Validate it is a number greater than 0.
  - Ensure that a message is provided (arguments from index 3 onward); if missing, output a usage error.
  - Inform the user that the message is scheduled to be added after the delay.
  - Use `setTimeout` to wait for the specified delay, then:
    - Backup the existing chat history using `backupHistory(history)`.
    - Append the new message with the current timestamp to `history.messages`.
    - Write the updated chat history back to the file.
    - Output a success message indicating the scheduled message was added.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat schedule` subcommand covering scenarios such as:
  - **Valid Schedule:** Invoking `chat schedule` with a valid delay and message schedules the message and, after the delay (using fake timers/spies), the message is appended to the history.
  - **Invalid Delay:** Providing a non-numeric or zero/negative delay should produce an error.
  - **Missing Message:** When the message parameter is missing, an appropriate error is output.

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command documentation to include details and usage example for the new `chat schedule` subcommand. For example:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat schedule <delay_in_seconds> <your message>
  ```
- Document that this command allows users to schedule a message to be added after a specified delay, enabling timed contributions to a chat session.

## Rationale
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** Users can plan messages to be added at a later time, which is useful for reminders or delayed announcements within a chat.
- **Innovation:** This feature sets itself apart from instant chat commands by introducing time-dependent behavior without adding complexity.
- **Mission Alignment:** It continues our commitment to providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js by expanding the chat session’s capabilities with minimal changes to existing files.
features/rejects/CHAT_QUOTE.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_QUOTE.md
# CHAT_QUOTE Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand, `chat quote`, to the chat CLI utility. It allows users to quote an existing message by specifying its index. The quoted message is then appended as a new chat entry with a prefixed quote indicator, helping users highlight important messages for context or future reference without modifying the original message.

## Overview
- **Subcommand:** `chat quote <index>`
- **Functionality:**
  - Validates that the chat history exists and that the provided message index is valid.
  - Retrieves the specified message and prefixes it with a quote marker (e.g., `> `).
  - Appends the quoted message as a new message to the chat history with the current timestamp.
  - Provides console feedback confirming that the message was quoted successfully.
- **Files Affected:**
  - Source file: `src/lib/main.js`
  - Test file: `tests/unit/main.test.js`
  - Documentation: `README.md`
  - Dependencies file: `package.json` (if needed for minor adjustments but typically not necessary)

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new conditional branch in the main command handler for the `quote` subcommand.
- Steps in the new branch:
  - Check if the chat history file (`.chat_history.json`) exists. If not, output an error message.
  - Parse the chat history and validate the provided index (argument index 2). If the index is invalid, display an error.
  - Retrieve the message at the given index, prepend it with a quote marker (e.g., `> `), and create a new message object with the current timestamp.
  - Call the backup function (as done in edits) to preserve the current state before appending.
  - Append the newly created quoted message to the messages array.
  - Save the updated history back to the file.
  - Output a success message such as "Message quoted successfully.".

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat quote` subcommand:
  - **Valid Index:** Test that invoking `chat quote` with a valid index quotes the message, appends the new message, and updates the chat history.
  - **Invalid Index:** Test that invoking the command with an invalid index (non-numeric, negative, or out-of-bound) outputs an appropriate error message.
  - **No Chat History:** Test that if the chat history file does not exist, the command informs the user accordingly.

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command section to include the new usage example:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat quote <index>
  ```
- Document that this subcommand allows quoting an existing message by index, which appends a new message prefixed with a quotation marker to the chat history.

## Rationale
- **Enhanced Usability:** Enables users to quickly flag and reference previous messages by quoting them without altering the original history.
- **Consistency:** Complements other chat management subcommands (like edit, duplicate, undo) while adhering to the minimalist design of a single source file implementation.
- **Mission Alignment:** Supports the repository's mission to provide handy, file-based CLI utilities in Node.js by adding a valuable yet lightweight enhancement.
features/rejects/SECRETS_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/SECRETS_MANAGER.md
# SECRETS_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature introduces a secure secrets management utility to the CLI tool. It allows users to add, retrieve, list, and remove sensitive information (such as API keys or passwords) that are stored in an encrypted local file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json). The SECRETS_MANAGER is designed to complement the CONFIG_MANAGER and SECURITY_UTILS features by providing a dedicated mechanism for safe storage, retrieval, and deletion of secrets, thereby reinforcing the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration through secure and modular utility tools.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--secrets` that activates the secrets management module.
- **Sub-Commands:** The following sub-commands should be supported:
  - **add <key> <secret>:** Encrypts and stores the given secret under the provided key.
  - **get <key>:** Retrieves and decrypts the secret corresponding to the key.
  - **list:** Displays a list of stored keys (without revealing the secrets).
  - **remove <key>:** Deletes the stored secret for the specified key.
- The module should prompt for a master password on first use or allow it to be provided through an environment variable (e.g., SECRETS_MASTER) to initialize the encryption mechanism.

## Implementation Details
- **Encryption:** Utilize Node's `crypto` module to perform symmetric encryption and decryption. The master password (or a derived key) is used for encrypting the secrets before storing them in the JSON file.
- **Data File:** The secrets are persisted in a file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json) stored locally. All data written to the file must be encrypted.
- **Operational Flow:**
  - When adding a secret, the module encrypts the secret and saves it under the provided key.
  - When retrieving, the module decrypts the value using the master password.
  - Listing secrets shows only the keys, ensuring sensitive data is not accidentally exposed.
  - Removing a secret deletes the entry from the file.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Validate that the master password is provided or prompt the user accordingly.
- Check for duplicate keys when adding a new secret and warn the user if a key already exists.
- Provide clear error messages for incorrect decryption (e.g., when an incorrect master password is provided), missing keys, or file I/O issues.
- Ensure that sensitive error details are not exposed in logs.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to cover each sub-command (add, get, list, remove) ensuring correct encryption, decryption, and error handling. Tests should simulate scenarios including invalid master passwords and handling of non-existent keys.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets add API_KEY mySecretValue`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets get API_KEY`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets list`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets remove API_KEY`
- Provide inline comments in the source code to explain encryption logic and error management.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SECRETS_MANAGER feature reinforces the repository’s mission by adding secure, modular functionality for handling sensitive configurations. This tool supports healthy collaboration and automation by enabling users to safely manage secrets within a single, self-contained CLI repository.features/rejects/CHAT_SESSION.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_SESSION.md
# CHAT_SESSION Feature Specification

This feature introduces an interactive chat session mode in the CLI tool. It leverages the repository’s support for persistent multi-turn conversation along with optional session titling. When the user invokes the CLI with the "chat" command, the tool will initiate an interactive chat session, where input is read from the terminal and the conversation is stored in the persistent history file (`.chat_history.json`).

## Overview

The CHAT_SESSION feature provides an interactive mode to engage in multi-turn conversations directly via the CLI. It allows a user to start a session with an optional title, follow an interactive prompt, and have all conversation turns be appended to the history file. This enhancement clearly aligns with the repository mission to provide handy CLI utilities while taking advantage of the persistent chat functionality described in package metadata.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- Update the main function to detect if the first argument is "chat".
- When the "chat" command is detected, initialize an interactive session using Node.js’ built-in `readline` module.
- Optionally read a session title from CLI arguments (e.g., `--title="My Session"`) and display it at the start of the session.
- As the user inputs messages, the session will echo acknowledgement and simulate storing the input into the `.chat_history.json` file (for actual persistence, further implementation would be required, but this feature provides the CLI backbone for future enhancements).
- Ensure proper exit when the user types a designated exit command (e.g., `exit` or via CTRL+C).

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- Add tests to simulate invoking the CLI with the "chat" command.
- Since an interactive session may be difficult to simulate fully in unit tests, include tests to verify that the proper prompt message (e.g., "Entering chat session...") is printed when invoking the chat command.
- Mock the readline interface to simulate session termination and input handling.

### README File (README.md):
- Update the documentation with a new section describing the interactive chat session.
- Provide usage examples such as:
    - `node src/lib/main.js chat`
    - `node src/lib/main.js chat --title="Project Discussion"`
- Explain the purpose of the interactive chat mode and its benefits for persistent conversation logging.

### Dependencies (package.json):
- No additional dependencies are required, as the feature uses Node.js’ built-in `readline` module.
- Ensure that any necessary changes to scripts (if any) are minimal and aligned with the current CLI usage.

## Benefits

- Provides an interactive mode for engaging in multi-turn conversations directly in the terminal.
- Enhances user experience by allowing session titling and simulating persistent chat history functionality.
- Aligns with the mission of the repository to deliver handy CLI utilities in Node.js, building upon the existing export and import chat features.
features/rejects/CHAT_CLEAR.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_CLEAR.md
# CHAT_CLEAR Feature

This feature extends the existing chat functionality by adding a new subcommand, `clear`, which allows users to delete the existing chat history file (`.chat_history.json`). This update is aimed at enhancing usability by providing an easy mechanism to reset or clear the stored conversation history.

## Changes in Source File (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a condition to check if the first argument is `chat` and the second argument is `clear`.
- If the `clear` command is detected, the code should attempt to delete the `.chat_history.json` file if it exists.
- Provide appropriate console feedback to the user indicating success or failure (e.g., "Chat history cleared." or an error message if deletion fails).

## Changes in Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests to ensure that when the `clear` subcommand is executed:
  - The `.chat_history.json` file is removed if it exists.
  - The output message confirms the clearance of the chat history.
  - Edge cases (e.g., trying to clear when no history file exists) are properly handled.

## Changes in README.md
- Update the Chat Command section to document the new `clear` option. For example:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat clear
  ```
  This command will remove the current chat history.

## Rationale
- Provides users with better control over their conversation history.
- Maintains consistency with the repository's mission to offer handy CLI utilities in Node.js with simple file-based persistence.
- Enhances the overall usability of the chat feature without introducing complexity or new files.

## Implementation Considerations
- The deletion of the chat history file should handle potential errors, such as file not existing, with graceful error handling and user notification.
- Ensure tests are idempotent and do not interfere with other tests or operations.
features/rejects/CONVERTER.md
# features/rejects/CONVERTER.md
# OVERVIEW
This feature consolidates various conversion operations into a single, unified CLI command. It merges numeral conversion (between different bases), unit conversion (e.g. temperature and distance), and date conversion (date addition and difference) into one tool. This consolidation simplifies the command structure, reduces redundancy, and aligns with the repository’s mission of providing modular, self-contained automation utilities.

# CLI INTEGRATION
- **Unified Flag:** Introduce a single flag `--convert` to handle all conversion tasks.
- **Mode Selection:**
  - **Numeral Conversion Mode:** When provided with three parameters — a number (as a string), the source base, and the target base — the command validates bases (between 2 and 36) and converts the numeral using built-in JavaScript methods.
  - **Unit Conversion Mode:** When provided with four parameters — a conversion category (e.g. `temp` or `distance`), source unit, target unit, and numeric value — the utility applies the relevant formula (e.g. Celsius to Fahrenheit, meters to kilometers).
  - **Date Conversion Mode:** Supports two sub-modes:
    - **Date Difference:** When provided with two date strings, it calculates the number of days between the dates.
    - **Date Addition:** When provided with a date string and a numeric value, it adds (or subtracts) days to return a new date in ISO format.

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Input Parsing & Validation:** The command dynamically examines the number and type of parameters to select the appropriate conversion mode. It includes robust error handling, offering clear messages if inputs are missing or incorrectly formatted.
- **Output Formatting:** Consistent with global settings, the command outputs results in plain text or JSON (if --json or --json-pretty is active) and includes metadata such as timestamp and execution duration.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests cover all three modes to ensure accurate conversions and error messages. Documentation is updated with examples for numeral, unit, and date conversions.

# ALIGNMENT WITH REPOSITORY MISSION
By merging number, unit, and date conversion functionalities into the CONVERTER feature, the repository enhances usability and reduces complexity. This streamlined utility supports efficient automation workflows and reinforces the mission of healthy collaboration through a modular, single-source file CLI tool.features/rejects/TIME_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/TIME_MANAGER.md
# TIME_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates time utilities and command scheduling into one unified module. In addition to providing standard time and date operations (such as obtaining the current timestamp, date formatting, and calculating differences between timestamps), the module introduces a scheduler that enables users to queue CLI commands for future execution. Schedules can be set for a specific date/time or after a defined duration, with all scheduled commands stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_schedule.json`).

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** A new flag `--time` activates the TIME_MANAGER module, which now supports both time operations and scheduling sub-commands.
- **Sub-Commands for Time Utilities:**
  - **now:** Returns the current timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
  - **format:** Formats a given timestamp using a provided formatting string.
  - **diff:** Calculates the difference between two timestamps.
  - **add/subtract:** Performs arithmetic with timestamps using duration strings (e.g., "1h15m").

- **Sub-Commands for Scheduling:**
  - **schedule add <time> <command> [arguments]:** Schedules a CLI command to be executed at a specified future time or after a specified delay. The `<time>` parameter can be an ISO timestamp or a duration (e.g., "2h30m").
  - **schedule list:** Displays all scheduled commands with their scheduled execution times and unique identifiers.
  - **schedule remove <id>:** Cancels a scheduled command identified by its unique ID.

## Implementation Details
- **Time Operations:** Maintains the existing functionality for time formatting, differences, and arithmetic, utilizing JavaScript's native Date object and optional lightweight libraries if needed.
- **Scheduling Mechanism:**
  - Scheduled commands are stored in a local JSON file (`.repository_schedule.json`) including details such as the command, its arguments, scheduled time, and a generated unique ID.
  - When a scheduled time is reached (or the delay expires), the scheduler invokes the corresponding command using the same command processing logic as the primary CLI.
  - The scheduler operates either in the background (if the CLI is running continuously) or is triggered on-demand to execute due commands.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate scheduling scenarios, including adding, listing, and removing scheduled commands, as well as verifying that commands execute correctly when their scheduled time arrives.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples, such as:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time now`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time format "2023-10-07T12:00:00Z" "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule add "2023-10-07T15:00:00Z" "--sum" 3 4 5`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule list`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule remove 12345`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging time utilities and command scheduling into a single, modular module, TIME_MANAGER enhances automation capabilities and promotes healthy collaboration. Users can not only perform standard time manipulations but also schedule tasks directly through the CLI, thereby streamlining workflows and reducing context switching.
features/rejects/HTTP_API.md
# features/rejects/HTTP_API.md
# HTTP_API

## Overview
This feature adds a lightweight HTTP server to the repository that exposes key CLI functionalities as endpoints. In addition to endpoints for version, diagnostics, help, health, and configuration, it now also integrates a new **/scheduler** endpoint for managing scheduled tasks and a new **/profile** endpoint for runtime performance diagnostics. These additions further support the repository’s mission by providing robust, actionable diagnostics, improved CI/CD integration, and enhanced operational insights—all within a single, maintainable module.

## Existing Endpoints
- **`/`**: Returns a welcome message with an overview of available endpoints.
- **`/diagnostics`**: Outputs extended diagnostics information (similar to the `--diagnostics` CLI flag) in JSON format.
- **`/version`**: Reads and returns the application version from `package.json` in both plain text and JSON formats.
- **`/help`**: Provides help content that mirrors the `--help` CLI flag output.
- **`/health`**: Returns a JSON object indicating the operational status of key services (e.g. configuration management, logging, CLI readiness).
- **`/config`**: Retrieves the current configuration settings, with sensitive keys masked for security.
- **`/scheduler`**: Lists scheduled tasks and their statuses, supporting optional query parameters for filtering and sorting.

## New /profile Endpoint
- **Purpose:** Provides real-time performance metrics and runtime diagnostics of the application.
- **Behavior:**
  - Measures execution time of recent commands, memory usage, and other performance-related data.
  - Returns the metrics as a JSON object to facilitate integration with monitoring tools or CI/CD pipelines.
  - Ensures that the profiling data is computed efficiently so as not to impact overall server performance.

## Implementation Details
- **Server Initialization:**
  - Utilizes Node.js’s built-in HTTP module to create a server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3000).
  - The server is initialized from the main CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) when the `--serve` flag is provided.

- **Endpoint Integration:**
  - All endpoint logic, including the new `/profile` endpoint, is encapsulated within a single module (e.g. `src/lib/httpApi.js`).
  - The `/profile` endpoint aggregates runtime data such as command execution timings and memory usage.
  - Robust error handling is implemented for unsupported routes, with standard 404 responses in JSON format.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simulate HTTP requests to all endpoints, including `/scheduler` and the new `/profile` endpoint, verifying correct HTTP statuses and response formats.
  - Use mocks to replicate both successful and error conditions for performance metric collection.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Verify that enabling the HTTP server does not interfere with other CLI operations.
  - Ensure graceful handling of scenarios where configuration or performance data is missing or malformed.

## Documentation
- **README Update:**
  - Add a section describing the HTTP API features, with usage examples for starting the server and accessing the new `/scheduler` and `/profile` endpoints.
  - Include instructions on using the `--serve` flag and details on the available endpoints.

## Benefits
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics:** Aggregates diagnostic and performance data, enhancing transparency and enabling proactive monitoring.
- **Operational Insights:** The `/profile` endpoint facilitates real-time monitoring of command execution performance, aiding CI/CD pipeline integrations.
- **Enhanced Flexibility:** Provides developers and automated systems with more granular control and visibility over runtime behavior, supporting efficient troubleshooting and system optimization.features/rejects/CHAT_AUDIT.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_AUDIT.md
# CHAT_AUDIT Feature

This feature introduces the `chat audit` subcommand for the chat CLI utility. It allows users to review the history of modifications saved in the undo stack. By listing the backup states, users gain insight into previous chat history snapshots prior to modifications, which can help in understanding the sequence of changes and diagnosing issues.

## Overview
- **Subcommand:** `chat audit`
- **Functionality:** Reads the persistent chat history from `.chat_history.json` and, if available, inspects the `_undoStack` property. For each backup in the undo stack, it displays a summary including the session title and the number of messages in that backup. If no backup exists or if the file itself is missing, an appropriate message is shown.
- **Target Files:** Updates will be made in the source file (`src/lib/main.js`), test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), and README (`README.md`).

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- **New Function:** Add a new function `handleAudit()` that does the following:
  - Check if the chat history file exists; if not, print "No chat history available for audit." and return.
  - Load and parse the chat history file. If an `_undoStack` is not found or is empty, display a message such as "No audit history available.".
  - If the `_undoStack` exists, iterate over its entries and for each backup, print a summary line (for example: "Backup 1: Session 'Session Title', Messages: X").
  - Ensure proper error handling for file read/parse errors.
- **Integration:** In the `main` function, add a new case for the subcommand `audit` which calls `handleAudit()`.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat audit` subcommand:
  - Test that if no chat history file exists, executing the audit command results in output "No chat history available for audit.".
  - Test that if a chat history file exists but the `_undoStack` is empty or missing, the command outputs "No audit history available.".
  - Test that if the chat history file contains backups in `_undoStack`, the command outputs a summary for each backup. For example, create a dummy history with an `_undoStack` array containing objects with a `sessionTitle` and `messages` array, then verify that the output includes the expected backup summaries.

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command section to document the new `chat audit` subcommand:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat audit
  ```
- Include a brief description stating that this command provides a review of the undo backup history, summarizing past states of the chat history.

## Rationale
- **Enhanced Transparency:** By exposing the undo stack, users can better understand the sequence of changes made to the chat history.
- **Debugging and Recovery:** This feature can help users diagnose issues by revealing what changes have been captured automatically and when they occurred.
- **Mission Alignment:** It reinforces our mission to provide handy CLI utilities in Node.js by offering deeper insights into the multi-level undo functionality already implemented.

# CLI_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates all aspects of the command-line interface into a single, unified module. It merges interactive improvements (such as real-time command suggestions, history search, and auto-completion) with robust argument parsing and routing. Additionally, this update integrates usage analytics directly within the CLI, capturing command frequency and user interaction data. By unifying these functionalities, the repository reduces code duplication, streamlines CL interface operations, and provides actionable insights to optimize the user experience.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized CLI Processing:**
  - Merge interactive session capabilities (real-time suggestions, command history, REPL-like features) with structured flag parsing using libraries such as Node.js's readline and Zod for schema validation.
  - Route all commands through a single module (`src/lib/cliManager.js`) to ensure consistency in help outputs, error handling, and interactive prompt behavior.

- **Usage Analytics Integration:**
  - Integrate analytics logic within the CLI manager to intercept and log every command execution along with timestamps and arguments.
  - Store analytics data in a JSON file (e.g. `usage.json`) that tracks frequency and recency of commands, replacing the separate USAGE_ANALYTICS module.
  - Provide a CLI flag (e.g. `--usage-analytics`) to display a summary report of command usage in both human-readable and JSON formats.

- **Error Handling and Backward Compatibility:**
  - Ensure that enhancements in auto-completion and usage tracking do not interfere with existing CLI operations.
  - Maintain robust error messaging for invalid or malformed commands, with clear guidance for user correction.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simulate various CLI inputs (both interactive and scripted) to validate that suggestions, history retrieval, and auto-completion work seamlessly.
  - Verify that command executions are correctly logged in `usage.json` and that the analytics report accurately reflects command usage.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test scenarios with missing or corrupted analytics data files and ensure graceful degradation (e.g. in-memory logging fallback).
  - Validate behavior when users input unexpected commands or use unsupported flags.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents with new usage examples demonstrating interactive sessions, command auto-completion, and usage analytics reporting (via the `--usage-analytics` flag).
- Provide detailed API references for the CLI manager functions, including configuration options and customization of analytics data capture.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience:** By combining interactive CLI improvements with usage tracking, users receive a more intuitive and responsive command-line interface.

features/rejects/SELF_UPDATE.md
# features/rejects/SELF_UPDATE.md
# SELF_UPDATE

## Overview
This feature introduces self-update functionality to the repository0 CLI tool. When invoked with the new flag `--self-update`, the tool checks for a newer version available on the npm registry and performs an update if confirmed by the user. This feature ensures users always run the latest version with bug fixes, performance improvements, and new capabilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global CLI flag `--self-update`.
- **Behavior:** When the flag is provided, the CLI will connect to the npm registry (or a defined update endpoint) to retrieve the latest version information for `@xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`.
- **User Interaction:** After fetching the version details, the tool informs the user of the current and latest version. It then either automatically update (if a `--force` flag is provided) or ask for confirmation before proceeding with self-update.

## Implementation Details
- **Version Check:** Use Node's `child_process.exec` or a lightweight HTTP request to query the npm registry for the latest version.
- **Update Mechanism:** If an update is available, execute a system command (e.g., `npm install -g @xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`) to perform the update. This command can run asynchronously and report progress.
- **Feedback & Logging:** The self-update process outputs status messages in both plain text and JSON modes. Metadata such as current version, new version, and update duration is included in the response.

## Error Handling & Testing
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages if the update check fails due to network issues or permission errors while attempting to update. If the CLI does not have sufficient privileges, notify the user with steps to update manually.
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate a successful version check and update, as well as error scenarios. Integration tests should verify the update command is executed correctly in a dry-run mode to avoid unintended changes.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SELF_UPDATE feature reinforces the mission of repository0 by enhancing the maintainability and reliability of the CLI tool. By allowing users to easily keep their tool up-to-date, it promotes healthy collaboration and ensures that everyone benefits from the latest automated improvements without manual intervention.features/rejects/CHAT_REACT.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_REACT.md
# CHAT_REACT Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand, `chat react`, to the chat CLI utility. It allows users to add an emoji reaction or similar indicator to an existing chat message without modifying its original content. The reaction is stored within the message object as a new `reaction` property.

## Overview

- **Subcommand:** `chat react <index> <reaction>`
- **Functionality:**
  - Verifies that the chat history file exists.
  - Parses the chat history and validates that the provided message index is within bounds.
  - Ensures that a reaction parameter is supplied; if not, outputs a usage error.
  - Updates the target message by adding or updating a `reaction` property with the provided reaction string.
  - Backs up the current chat history using the `backupHistory` function before making modifications.
  - Saves the updated history back to the file and outputs a confirmation message.

  - Implement `handleReact(args)` with the following steps:
    - Check if the chat history file exists; if not, log an error and return.
    - Parse the chat history from the `.chat_history.json` file.
    - Validate that `args[2]` (the message index) is a valid number and within the messages array length. If invalid, output an error message.
    - Validate that `args[3]` (the reaction) is provided. If missing, output a usage error.
    - Call `backupHistory(history)` to create a backup of the current state.
    - Update the target message object by setting `history.messages[index].reaction = args[3]`.
    - Write the modified history back to the file.
    - Log a confirmation message indicating that the reaction has been added or updated.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- **Add Unit Tests for `chat react`:**
  - Test that invoking `chat react` with a valid index and reaction updates the target message with the correct `reaction` property.
  - Test error handling when the chat history file does not exist.

# features/rejects/CHAT_NOTIFY.md
# CHAT_NOTIFY Feature

This feature introduces a new subcommand, `chat notify`, which allows users to toggle desktop notifications for new chat messages. When notifications are enabled, each new chat message received via the chat session will trigger a desktop notification, enhancing user awareness of incoming messages.

## Overview
- **Subcommand:** `chat notify <on|off>`
- **Functionality:**
  - Allows users to enable (`on`) or disable (`off`) desktop notifications for new chat messages.
  - Stores the notification preference in the chat history file by adding a new property, `enableNotifications`.
  - When enabled, the chat session handler will trigger a desktop notification (using the `node-notifier` package) each time a new chat message is appended.
  - Provides appropriate success feedback to the console.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- **Dependency Addition:**
  - Add `node-notifier` as a dependency in `package.json` (e.g., "^10.0.0").
- **New Function - `handleNotify(args)`:**
  - Parse the command argument to check if notifications should be turned on or off.
  - Load or initialize the chat history file.
  - Update (or create) a new property `enableNotifications` with a boolean value (true for "on", false for "off").
  - Write the updated history back to the file and output a confirmation message.
- **Modification in `handleChatSession(args)`:**
  - After appending a new chat message, check if `history.enableNotifications` is true.
  - If true, require and use `node-notifier` to trigger a desktop notification showing the new message content along with a timestamp.
- **Update Main Switch-Case:**
  - Add a new case for "notify" that calls `handleNotify(args)`.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat notify` subcommand:
  - **Toggle On:** Test that invoking `chat notify on` sets the `enableNotifications` property to true in the chat history file and outputs a success message.
  - **Toggle Off:** Test that invoking `chat notify off` sets the property to false and outputs a corresponding message.
  - **Notification Trigger:** Optionally, use a spy/mocking mechanism for the `node-notifier` module to verify that when a new chat message is received with notifications enabled, the notify function is called with the expected parameters.

## README.md Updates
- Add documentation for the new `chat notify` subcommand in the Chat Command section:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat notify <on|off>
  ```
- Include a brief explanation that this command toggles desktop notifications for new chat messages, allowing users to be alerted of incoming messages even when not actively monitoring the terminal.

## Rationale

features/rejects/ERROR_HELP.md
# features/rejects/ERROR_HELP.md
# ERROR_HELP & COLOR + I18N

## Overview
The updated ERROR_HELP feature not only provides dynamic, context-aware troubleshooting and color-coded output for improved readability, but it now also integrates internationalization (I18N) support. This enhancement enables error, warning, and help messages to be displayed in multiple languages based on user preference, further reducing friction and promoting healthy collaboration across diverse user bases.

## Internationalization Support
- **Language Configuration:** Users can now specify their preferred language for CLI output via an environment variable (e.g., `CLI_LANGUAGE`). Supported languages include English (`en`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), and additional languages can be added via configuration.
- **Localized Messages:** Error messages, warnings, and troubleshooting hints are mapped via a lightweight dictionary in the source code. If a translation for a specific message is unavailable in the selected language, the system gracefully falls back to English.
- **CLI Flag Integration:** In non-JSON mode, localized messages still appear with ANSI color coding (red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for successes). In JSON mode, the output remains plain but includes a field noting the active language.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Variable:** The new variable `CLI_LANGUAGE` determines the language of output messages. Default value is `en` if the variable is unset or the specified language is unsupported.
- **Dictionary Mapping:** A simple mapping object pairs message keys with translations for each supported language. For example:
  - `ERROR_NO_INPUT`: { en: "Error: No valid numeric inputs provided.", es: "Error: No se proporcionaron entradas numéricas válidas.", fr: "Erreur : Aucune entrée numérique valide fournie." }
- **Integration with Existing Logic:** The helper functions `sendError` and `sendSuccess` are updated to select the appropriate localized message based on the current setting. The existing warning aggregation and ANSI formatting remain unchanged.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests should verify that messages appear in the selected language. Documentation is updated (README and CONTRIBUTING) to instruct users on setting `CLI_LANGUAGE` and adding new translations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By adding internationalization support to ERROR_HELP, the repository further embraces its mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. Users from diverse linguistic backgrounds can now interact with the CLI tool in their native language, lowering barriers and enhancing accessibility.

features/rejects/DOCS_GENERATOR.md
# features/rejects/DOCS_GENERATOR.md
# DOCS_GENERATOR

## Overview
This feature introduces an automated documentation generator that aggregates and compiles the various markdown documentation files present in the repository (including feature specifications, README, CONTRIBUTING, MISSION, and others) into a single unified document. The generated documentation will provide a comprehensive, navigable index of all repository components, making it easier for contributors and users to obtain an overview and locate specific information.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--generate-docs`) that triggers the documentation generation process from the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`).
  - Upon invocation, the module scans the designated documentation directories (such as the `/features` folder, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and MISSION.md) and aggregates their content.

- **Aggregation Process:**
  - Read markdown files using Node.js built-in file system methods (`fs`, `path`), and merge them in a defined order (e.g., starting with MISSION, then CONTRIBUTING, followed by feature-specific files).
  - Generate an index with anchors linking directly to their corresponding sections. Each feature file’s title (extracted from its first level heading) will be used in the table of contents.
  - Optionally format the aggregated document with consistent markdown styling, using minimal dependencies to ensure maintainability.

- **Output Options:**
  - By default, output the aggregated documentation to a new file (e.g. `DOCUMENTATION.md`) in the repository root.
  - Support an optional `--stdout` flag to print the generated documentation directly to the console (in case of automated pipelines).

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/docsGenerator.test.js`) to simulate scanning directories and verify that the combined output includes all required sections.
  - Test file ordering, correct insertion of table of contents links, and edge cases such as missing documentation files.

## Documentation & Benefits
- **Usage Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage instructions for the `--generate-docs` flag.
  - Provide examples on how to invoke the documentation generator for both file output and STDOUT display.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Centralization:** Provides a single point of reference for repository documentation, reducing fragmentation across multiple files.
  - **Ease of Navigation:** A comprehensive table of contents makes it simple for users and contributors to locate specific information.
  - **Maintainability:** Automates the process of keeping documentation up-to-date, supporting the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined CI/CD workflows.
features/rejects/CHAT_UNDO.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_UNDO.md
# CHAT_UNDO Feature

This feature adds an "undo" subcommand to the chat CLI utility. It allows the user to remove the last appended message from the persistent chat history file (.chat_history.json). This functionality is useful for quickly reverting any accidental chat message without manually editing the file.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new branch for the `chat undo` subcommand under the main `chat` command.
- Check if the chat history file exists. If not, output "No chat history available.".
- If the file exists, parse the JSON data and check whether there is at least one message.
  - If there are messages, remove the last message from the messages array and write the updated history back to the file. Display a confirmation message such as "Last message undone.".
  - If no messages remain, display a message indicating that there are no messages to undo.
- Ensure proper error handling if the file cannot be read or written.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat undo` subcommand:
  - Test that when `chat undo` is invoked with no chat history file, the output correctly indicates the absence of chat history.
  - Test that when the chat history exists and contains one or more messages, invoking `chat undo` removes the last message and updates the file accordingly.
  - Test the scenario where the chat history contains a single message. After undoing, verify that the output indicates that no messages remain to be undone.

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command section to document the new `chat undo` subcommand. Include an example command:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat undo
  ```
- Explain that the command removes the last appended message from the chat history, enabling users to quickly revert their last entry.

## Rationale
- **Usability:** Provides an easy way for users to correct accidental or unwanted chat entries.
- **Consistency:** Complements existing chat functionalities while maintaining simplicity by modifying only the source, test, and documentation files.
- **Mission Alignment:** Enhances the repository's mission to offer handy CLI utilities in Node.js by improving chat session management.
features/REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE.md
# features/REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE.md
# REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE Enhancement: CLI Help & Validation Removal

This update not only reinforces the CLI help functionality but also removes all mentions of NaN and input validation from the repository. The goal is to simplify the core gcd utility and related tests while keeping the CLI help feature intact.

## Overview

- **CLI Help Utility:** When the user supplies the 'help' argument at runtime, the program displays a detailed usage message that outlines available commands and links to documentation.
- **Validation Removal:** All explicit input validations (including any checks that could relate to NaN or non-positive integers) in the gcd function are removed. This means the gcd function will operate without error-checking for inputs, and associated tests will be updated accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js)

- **CLI Help:**
  - Maintain the check for the 'help' argument and display the detailed help message as before.

- **GCD Function:**
  - Remove the input validation block that checks for non-positive integers or non-integer values.
  - The updated gcd function will simply compute the greatest common divisor without performing any input type or validity checks.
  - Example updated code:
    ```javascript
    export function gcd(a, b) {
      while (b !== 0) {
        const temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
      }
      return a;
    }
    ```

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- **CLI Help Test:**
  - Continue to simulate running with the 'help' argument and verify the correct CLI help message is output.

- **GCD Tests:**
  - Retain tests that check correct gcd computation on positive integers (e.g. gcd(48, 18) returns 6, etc.).
  - **Remove** the test case that expects an error to be thrown on non-positive integers since validation checks have been removed.

### README Update (README.md)

- Update the documentation to remove any mention of validation rules or error messages related to the gcd function.
- Ensure that usage examples focus on the functionality of gcd and the CLI help feature without referencing input validation expectations.

### Dependencies (package.json)

- No changes to dependencies or scripts are required for this update.

## Testing and Validation

- **CLI Help:** Running `node src/lib/main.js help` should output the updated help message with usage instructions and documentation links.
- **GCD Function:** Verify that the gcd function computes correct results for valid inputs and that the removed validation does not cause unintended side effects in the provided test cases (i.e. tests for error conditions on invalid input are removed).

This consolidated update aligns with the repository’s mission to provide a simple, maintainable CLI utility that acts as a JS library function while removing extraneous validation logic.
