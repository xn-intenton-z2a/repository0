# INTERACTIVE & TUTORIAL

## Overview
In addition to the existing interactive REPL and batch processing modes, this update integrates a new **tutorial sub-mode** within the INTERACTIVE feature. The tutorial mode provides a guided, step-by-step walkthrough of the CLI tool’s functionality, offering new users an engaging introduction and practical examples of available commands. This extension streamlines onboarding and empowers users to learn the tool’s capabilities quickly, in line with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration.

## CLI Integration
- **Invocation:** The tutorial mode can be activated by adding a new sub-command (e.g., `tutorial`) to the interactive flag. For example:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --interactive tutorial`
- **Mode Selection:** When the `tutorial` sub-mode is detected, the CLI will present a series of guided screens with instructions, example commands, and tips on using various sub-commands (such as arithmetic operations, configuration, and security utilities).
- **Fallback Behavior:** If users input an unknown command within the interactive session, the tutorial mode can offer contextual help and suggest usage examples.

## Implementation Details
- **Guided Walkthrough:** The tutorial will run in a text-based format, displaying instructions sequentially. It may include prompts for user input to simulate command execution and provide immediate feedback.
- **Incremental Learning:** The tutorial is structured in sections, each focusing on a set of related commands (e.g., basic math commands, configuration management, and advanced utilities) with a brief description, example commands, and expected output.
- **Integration with REPL:** Users can switch between the guided tutorial and regular REPL mode or exit the tutorial to return to standard interactive sessions.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Robust parsing of sub-commands ensures that users invoking the tutorial mode receive the proper instructional content.
- Any invalid or unsupported inputs during the tutorial sequence trigger informative error messages, directing users back to the main tutorial navigation.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate tutorial mode interactions, verifying that each tutorial screen displays the correct information and that navigation commands work as expected.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated to include examples of launching the tutorial. Inline comments in the source code explain the instructional logic and navigation flow.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By embedding an interactive tutorial within the existing INTERACTIVE feature, this update enhances user onboarding and helps maintain streamlined automation workflows. It fosters healthy collaboration by reducing the learning curve for new users and ensuring that the tool's powerful functionalities are accessible and well-documented.features/rejects/CHAT_API.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_API.md
# CHAT_API

## Overview
The CHAT_API feature integrates Chat Completions (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT) into the CLI tool to allow users to supply prompts and receive generated content. In this update, the feature has been enhanced with improved conversation history caching, context continuity, and a dedicated sub-mode to directly generate GitHub issue templates. This makes it easier for users to obtain actionable issue templates or suggestions directly from command line interactions, thereby fostering healthy collaboration and streamlining the issue creation process.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** The global flag `--chat` triggers the Chat API functionality. An additional sub-command `issue` allows users to generate GitHub issue templates directly. For example:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --chat "Your prompt here"`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --chat issue "Bug: unexpected behavior in module"`

- **Input Parsing:** The CLI reads the prompt text and optionally accepts parameters such as `--max-tokens`, `--temperature`, and the `--chat-session` flag to maintain and incorporate conversation history in subsequent interactions.

## Implementation Details
- **API Integration:**
  - When a prompt is provided, the system checks if conversation history caching is active (via `--chat-session`) and prepends recent interactions for contextual relevance.
  - In `issue` sub-mode, the prompt is further processed to align with GitHub issue formatting guidelines. This includes adding sections such as **Steps to Reproduce**, **Expected Behavior**, and **Actual Behavior** if not already specified by the user.
  - The API call is executed with provided parameters, and the response is parsed and forwarded to the user.

- **Conversation History Caching:**
  - When `--chat-session` is active, the feature caches the last several interactions (e.g., the last 5 exchanges) in an in-memory store. This cached history is automatically included in future API calls to improve context and relevance.
  - The caching mechanism ensures sensitive information is not logged.

- **GitHub Issue Generation:**
  - In `issue` sub-mode, additional formatting logic processes the response to include actionable details suitable for GitHub issues.
  - The generated output includes metadata such as a suggested title, description, and steps to reproduce if applicable.
  - This mode integrates seamlessly with the chat conversation flow, allowing users to iterate on generated issue content.

## Error Handling & Testing
- **Error Reporting:**
  - Provides clear messages for network errors, missing API keys, or invalid user inputs (e.g., an unrecognized sub-command).
  - If the API call fails, the system returns a fallback message that includes any cached conversation context for troubleshooting.

- **Testing & Documentation:**
  - Unit tests simulate API calls and check for correct handling of both standard and `issue` sub-mode prompts, including response formatting and conversation history integration.
  - The README and CLI guides are updated with examples:
    - `node src/lib/main.js --chat "Generate a bug report template"`
    - `node src/lib/main.js --chat issue "Error when clicking button"`
  - Inline comments in the source code highlight the branching logic for handling chat sessions and issue generation mode.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enhancing CHAT_API with extended conversation continuity and a dedicated GitHub issue generation mode, this feature empowers users to transition quickly from ideation to actionable tasks. This integration supports the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and automating practical development workflows within a single, self-contained CLI tool.features/rejects/EXTENSIONS.md
# features/rejects/EXTENSIONS.md
# EXTENSIONS

## Overview
This feature consolidates two auxiliary CLI enhancements into one unified extension module. It merges dynamic plugin loading (formerly provided by the PLUGIN_SYSTEM feature) with shell auto-completion support (formerly provided by the SHELL_COMPLETION feature). This integrated approach not only reduces redundancy by fitting within the 15-feature limit but also enriches the CLI tool by offering customizable functionality extensions and improved user experience through command auto-completion.

## Plugin Integration
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:**
  - The CLI checks for a `plugins/` directory at startup and dynamically imports any `.js` files found there.
  - Each plugin must export a command identifier and a handler function, which are then seamlessly integrated into the CLI command mapping.
  - Loading errors or improperly structured plugins generate warnings without stopping execution.

## Shell Auto-Completion
- **Auto-Generation of Completion Scripts:**
  - A new global flag (e.g., `--completion`) lets users generate auto-completion scripts for popular shells such as Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
  - The CLI dynamically reads its internal command mapping, including all aliases, to produce a tailored completion script based on the user’s shell type.
  - Clear error messages are issued if an unsupported shell is detected or if the user does not provide a valid shell parameter.

## Integration and Benefits
- Consolidates two related extensions into one module to streamline the project and stay under the maximum feature limit.
- Enhances overall CLI usability by enabling both custom plugin support and shell auto-completion, reducing setup overhead for end users.
- Supports healthy collaboration through extensibility and improved productivity, in line with the repository’s mission.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate plugin loading from a temporary directory and validate correct generation of shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples:
  - Plugin example: Place JavaScript modules in the `plugins/` directory to add custom commands.
  - Completion example: `node src/lib/main.js --completion bash > repository_completion.sh`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging dynamic plugin integration and shell auto-completion into a single EXTENSIONS module, this feature reinforces our commitment to modular, self-contained, and user-friendly CLI utilities. This consolidation supports streamlined automation and healthy collaboration while keeping the repository's feature set within ideal limits.features/rejects/SYSTEM_UTILS.md
# features/rejects/SYSTEM_UTILS.md
# SYSTEM_UTILS & DEBUGGING

## Overview
This updated feature consolidates persistent configuration management, file logging, and now robust debugging tools into a single module. Users can view and modify CLI settings with a persistent JSON configuration file, log every command’s output, and trigger an extended debug mode to inspect internal state. This unification streamlines system introspection and auditability, reinforcing our mission of healthy collaboration and practical automation.

## CLI Integration

### Configuration Management & Persistent Logging
- **Configuration Commands:** Utilize the `--config` flag with subcommands:
  - `get [key]`: Retrieve specific or all configuration values from a persistent JSON file.
  - `set <key> <value>`: Update and save configuration settings.
  - `reset`: Reinitialize settings to default values.
- **File Logging:** With the global flag `--log-file <filename>`, every command’s output is appended in a JSON structured format to the specified file.

### Debugging Mode
- **Activation:** Introduce a new global flag `--debug` that can be used alongside other commands.
- **Behavior:** When the `--debug` flag is active, the system outputs extended diagnostic information including:
  - Current environment variables relevant to the CLI (e.g., `INVALID_TOKENS`, `ALLOW_NAN`, `TOKEN_PUNCTUATION_CONFIG`, and `DYNAMIC_WARNING_INDEX`).
  - Active configuration settings and their loaded state.
  - A summary of recent command audit logs (number of commands executed, execution durations, and any error counts).
  - Optional cache and performance metrics if available.
- **Output Modes:** Debug information is integrated into the normal output format:
  - In plain text mode, debug details are appended at the end of the command output in a clearly delimited section.
  - In JSON mode (with `--json` or `--json-pretty`), a dedicated `debug` field is added containing the diagnostic data.

## Implementation Details

- **File Operations:** On first run, a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) is created if missing. All read/write operations include error checks and fallbacks.
- **Logging:** Every CLI command is logged with metadata including timestamp, version, execution duration, and cleansed input parameters. Logs are written using Node’s `fs` module.
- **Debug Data Collection:** When `--debug` is provided, internal state is collected:
  - Environment configurations
  - Current settings from the persistent configuration file
  - Aggregated audit log statistics
  - Any cached computation data (if caching is enabled in related modules)
- **Error Handling:** Errors in configuration or file operations trigger clear messages without halting the debug output. If the debug mode encounters issues, warnings are issued but core configuration data is still returned.

## Testing & Documentation

- **Unit Tests:** Tests will simulate configuration gets/sets/resets, file logging operations, and debug command invocations to verify that state data and environment details are correctly output in both plain text and JSON formats.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples:
  - Without Debug: `node src/lib/main.js --config get`
  - With Debug: `node src/lib/main.js --debug --config get`
  - Logging Example: `node src/lib/main.js --log-file history.log --sum 3 4 5 --debug`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging persistent configuration, file logging, and an enhanced debugging mode into SYSTEM_UTILS, this feature provides comprehensive system introspection. It enhances transparency and traceability, streamlines troubleshooting, and solidifies the repository’s commitment to modular, self-contained CLI utilities that promote healthy collaboration and efficient automation.features/rejects/CHAT.md
# features/rejects/CHAT.md
# CHAT

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CHAT feature by maintaining an optional conversation context. In addition to the current functionality that sends a single query to the Chat Completions API and displays immediate responses, the feature now supports a multi-turn conversational mode. Users can choose to engage in an interactive session where past messages are preserved and sent along with new queries, yielding more contextually accurate responses.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Addition:** The `--chat` CLI flag remains available. A new optional flag `--context` can be provided to enable conversation mode. When `--context` is active, the session will maintain a conversation history in memory.
- **Interactive Mode:** In context mode, after the initial query is processed, the CLI remains open for further input, displaying a prompt (e.g., `chat>`) for subsequent queries. Users can type new messages which will be appended to the conversation history.
- **Session Termination:** Typing an exit command (such as `exit` or `quit`) will end the conversation and clear the history.

## API Interaction
- **Single Query Mode:** As before, when no conversation context is supplied, the command sends a standalone query to the Chat Completions API, reading the API key from the environment variable `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` and formatting the response appropriately (plain text or JSON with metadata).
- **Contextual Request Handling:** In conversation mode, the API call now includes an array of message objects representing the conversation history along with the latest query. This ensures that responses are generated with awareness of prior exchanges.
- **Response Formatting:** The response is displayed in plain text or JSON, including additional metadata (timestamp, execution duration) in JSON mode. The conversation mode also echoes the previous conversation to help users track context.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:** The command validates that a non-empty query is provided. If no query is given, a standardized error message is output.
- **API Errors:** Network issues or invalid API keys are caught and reported with clear error messages. When in conversation mode, if an error occurs, the session will prompt the user to either fix the issue or exit.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests simulate multi-turn interactions and verify that conversation history is maintained and correctly passed to the API. Both valid and error responses in context mode are tested.
- **Documentation:** Update the README to include usage examples, such as:
  - Single Query Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --chat "What is the weather today?"`
  - Conversation Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --chat --context "Tell me a joke"`, followed by additional inputs at the prompt.
- **Inline Comments:** In `src/lib/main.js`, comments explain the new conversation logic and how the conversation history is managed.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enabling a conversational context, this update enriches the CHAT feature to support interactive, multi-turn dialogues. This improvement promotes a more engaging user experience while reinforcing the mission of healthy collaboration and streamlined automation in a modular, single-file utility.
features/rejects/FILE_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/FILE_MANAGER.md
# Overview
This feature consolidates file handling operations and file watching capabilities into one unified module. FILE_MANAGER provides users with the ability to read, write, append, count, and search file contents, while also monitoring files or directories for changes. This consolidated approach reduces redundancy and streamlines file-based automation tasks, aligning with the repository’s goal of modular and self-contained CLI utilities.

# CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--file` that activates FILE_MANAGER.
- **Sub-Commands for File Operations:**
  - `read <filename>`: Outputs the content of the file.
  - `write <filename> <content>`: Writes (or overwrites) content to the file.
  - `append <filename> <content>`: Appends content to the file.
  - `count <filename>`: Displays counts of lines, words, and characters.
  - `search <filename> <pattern>`: Searches for a regex pattern and returns matching lines.
- **Sub-Commands for File Watching:**
  - `watch <path>`: Monitors a file or directory for changes.
  - `on-change <command>`: Specifies the CLI command(s) to execute when change is detected.
  - Optional flag `--debounce <milliseconds>`: Configures a debounce interval to reduce rapid re-triggering.

# Implementation Details
- **File Operations:** Leverage Node’s built-in `fs` module to perform asynchronous file I/O operations with appropriate error handling for missing files or permission issues.
- **File Watching:** Use `fs.watch` or `fs.watchFile` to detect file system changes. Upon detecting changes, execute the specified command(s) using child process invocation. Incorporate a debounce mechanism to aggregate rapid changes.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear, descriptive error messages and warnings when file operations or monitoring fail, ensuring the CLI remains resilient.
- **Integration:** The feature integrates into the global CLI, respecting global flags (e.g., JSON output mode) and consistent conventions with other modules.

# Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Include tests simulating file operations using temporary files, and file watching events with controlled changes to validate command triggering and debounce functionality.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and inline comments to describe the usage of the FILE_MANAGER including examples like:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --file read ./example.txt`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --file watch ./src --on-change "npm run build" --debounce 500`

# Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging file operations and monitoring in a single, cohesive module, FILE_MANAGER reinforces the repository’s mission of providing streamlined, self-contained CLI utilities that aid in development automation and enhance collaborative workflows.features/rejects/SECURITY_UTILS.md
# features/rejects/SECURITY_UTILS.md
# SECURITY_UTILS

## Overview
This feature consolidates security-related utilities into a single, modular CLI command. It merges the existing password generation functionality with a new capability to generate secure UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). This unified approach not only provides users with a flexible tool for creating strong passwords but also offers a quick method to generate secure, randomized identifiers, aligning with the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined automation.

## Implementation Details
### Command Integration
- **Unified Flag:** Introduce a new CLI flag `--security` which activates the security utilities module. Depending on sub-commands provided, the module will operate in one of two modes:
  - **Password Mode:** When the sub-command is `password` (or if no recognized sub-command is provided and numeric arguments are detected), the module generates a secure password.
    - **Parameters:** Accepts an optional numeric argument for password length (default is 12). Additional flags include `--include-uppercase`, `--include-digits`, and `--include-symbols` to customize the character set.
    - **Logic:** By default, includes lowercase letters. Conditionally appends uppercase letters, digits, and symbols based on flags. Uses Node's `crypto` module (e.g., `crypto.randomInt`) to randomly select characters until the desired length is reached.
  - **UUID Mode:** When the sub-command is `uuid`, the module generates a version 4 UUID.
    - **Parameters:** No additional parameters are required. Optionally, a flag (e.g., `--uppercase`) may be provided to output the UUID in uppercase.
    - **Logic:** Leverages Node's `crypto.randomUUID()` if available or an equivalent secure fallback to generate a truly random UUID.

### Error Handling & Validation
- Validate that the appropriate sub-command (`password` or `uuid`) is provided. If an unrecognized sub-command or insufficient parameters are detected, output a clear error message along with usage instructions for the `--security` command.
- For password generation:
  - Ensure the provided length is a positive integer within a sensible range (e.g., 8 to 128).
  - Return a standardized error message if invalid flags or parameters are provided.
- For UUID generation:
  - If any extraneous parameters are supplied, ignore them and proceed to generate the UUID, while optionally warning the user of unused inputs.

### Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to verify that valid inputs for both password and UUID generation return the expected output.
  - Test error conditions where parameters are missing or invalid, ensuring that clear and consistent error messages are produced.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI usage documentation to include examples for both sub-commands, for instance:
    - Password: `node src/lib/main.js --security password 16 --include-uppercase --include-digits --include-symbols`
    - UUID: `node src/lib/main.js --security uuid`
  - Include inline comments in `src/lib/main.js` where the new `--security` command is integrated, clearly demarcating the branching logic between password and UUID generation.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By integrating two security utilities into a single feature, the SECURITY_UTILS module reinforces the repository’s mission of delivering modular, self-contained CLI utilities. It not only enhances security considerations within development workflows (through strong password creation) but also provides a practical tool for generating unique identifiers, thereby streamlining automation tasks.features/rejects/CONFIG_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/CONFIG_MANAGER.md
# CONFIG_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature enhances the current configuration output functionality by allowing users to both view and update runtime configuration settings. The CLI command now supports sub-commands to get, set, and reset configuration values that control behaviors such as numeric parsing (e.g., INVALID_TOKENS, ALLOW_NAN), punctuation stripping (TOKEN_PUNCTUATION_CONFIG), and warning options (DYNAMIC_WARNING_INDEX, DISABLE_NAN_SUGGESTION). Configuration changes are persisted to a local JSON file (e.g., .repository0config.json), enabling customization across sessions.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** The same flag `--config` is extended to support sub-commands:
  - `get`: Displays the current configuration settings.
  - `set <key> <value>`: Updates a configuration key with the provided value.
  - `reset`: Resets the configuration to default settings.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - On `get`, the command reads from the persistent config file as well as environment variables to show effective settings.
  - On `set`, the command validates that the key is among the allowed configuration keys and that the value is valid. The new setting is saved both in memory and to the persistent JSON file.
  - On `reset`, the command removes the persistent file or resets it to default values.
  - Fallback: If no sub-command is provided, the command behaves as the original `--config` by outputting the effective configuration.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Proper validation ensures that only pre-defined configuration keys can be modified. Invalid keys or values return an error message with usage instructions.
- File I/O errors when reading or writing the persistent configuration file are caught and reported, ensuring that the primary CLI functionality continues without disruption.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests cover all sub-commands (get, set, reset) to ensure configuration changes are correctly applied and persisted.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides are updated with examples:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --config get`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --config set ALLOW_NAN true`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --config reset`
- Inline code comments explain the validation and persistence logic.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enabling dynamic configuration management, the CONFIG_MANAGER feature fosters healthy collaboration and flexibility, allowing users to tailor the tool’s behavior to specific workflows. This improvement aligns with the repository’s mission of providing modular, self-contained utilities with practical customization options.features/rejects/NAN_HANDLER.md
# features/rejects/NAN_HANDLER.md
# NAN_HANDLER Feature Specification

## Overview
This update enhances the existing NAN_HANDLER functionality to support a broader range of configurable behaviors for improved CLI interactions. In addition to robust handling of NaN (Not a Number) values, this update introduces new capabilities including JSON output mode with metadata, configurable warning index settings, punctuation stripping, and suppression of NaN correction suggestions. This centralized approach ensures consistent behavior across the repository while maintaining easy runtime configuration via dedicated CLI flags.

## CLI Flags and Configuration

- **--allow-nan-inline:** Allows per-command inline acceptance of NaN values.
- **--diagnose-nan:** Provides detailed diagnostic output regarding NaN occurrences and configuration states.
- **--ignore-invalid:** Bypasses invalid input tokens during command parsing.
- **--json-output:** Activates JSON formatted output mode, which includes additional metadata for enhanced logging and integration purposes.
- **--warning-index:** Configures a warning index mode, allowing users to set custom thresholds for CLI warnings.
- **--strip-punctuation:** Enables the removal of unnecessary punctuation from input commands for cleaner data processing.
- **--suppress-nan-suggestions:** Disables automated correction suggestions related to NaN handling, giving users full control over their data processing logic.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized Configuration:** Integrate all configuration options into a central module that is accessible across the application, ensuring consistent state management.
- **CLI Integration:** Update the main CLI entry point (src/lib/main.js) to parse and apply these new flags while preserving existing behavior.
- **Output Handling:** Enhance output routines to support both standard text and JSON outputs, ensuring metadata is appended when in JSON mode.
- **Validation and Diagnostics:** Implement robust validation routines and diagnostic logging to help troubleshoot configuration issues, especially when multiple flags are used concurrently.

## Testing and Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Develop comprehensive tests to cover new flag behaviors, ensuring that each CLI flag triggers its expected functionality without interfering with others.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate consistency and reliability of the overall CLI behavior, particularly when multiple new flags are active simultaneously.
- **Documentation:** Update README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and inline code comments to reflect new capabilities and provide usage examples. Detailed CLI usage examples should illustrate how to combine new flags for advanced configuration.
features/rejects/DEBUG_MODE.md
# features/rejects/DEBUG_MODE.md
# DEBUG_MODE

## Overview
This feature introduces a debug mode to the CLI tool that provides detailed internal execution logs. When enabled, the CLI outputs extended diagnostic information, including raw input arguments, intermediate parsing results, environment configuration values, computed warnings, and execution metadata. This mode facilitates development, troubleshooting, and aids contributors in understanding the internal processing pipeline, thereby aligning with the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and effective automation.

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** The debug mode is enabled using a new global flag `--debug` that can be supplied alongside any other command.
- **Additional Logs:** Upon activation, the CLI prints extra logs which include:
  - The original raw input arguments and cleansed input echo.
  - Detailed output from the numeric parsing function (e.g., lists of valid and invalid tokens).
  - Environment configuration values relevant to processing (like `ALLOW_NAN`, `INVALID_TOKENS`, and `TOKEN_PUNCTUATION_CONFIG`).
  - Intermediate computation steps and timing details beyond the standard execution duration.
- **Behavior:** Debug output merges with existing success or error messages, ensuring that users receive both the primary command result and the extended diagnostics when `--debug` is active.

## Implementation Details
- **Logging Enhancements:** Modify the main CLI execution logic to check for the presence of the `--debug` flag. If present, additional debug statements will be printed to the console.
- **Modular Debug Function:** A helper function will be added to collate and output structured debug information. This function should not affect the normal operation of commands when the flag is absent.
- **Configuration Awareness:** Ensure that the debug mode reflects current environment settings and internal state (such as regex cache status) without exposing sensitive information.
- **Optional JSON Integration:** When combined with global JSON output mode (`--json` / `--json-pretty`), the debug information is merged into the resultant JSON structure under an optional `debugInfo` field.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to simulate command execution with and without the `--debug` flag. Verify that debug output is present when expected and that it contains key diagnostic information.
- **Documentation:** Update CLI usage instructions in README and CONTRIBUTING files to include examples of using the debug flag. Provide sample output and explain the additional fields.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By providing granular insight into the command processing pipeline, DEBUG_MODE enhances transparency and troubleshooting capabilities. This contribution supports the repository’s goals by facilitating healthful collaboration among developers and users, and by streamlining the debugging and development process in this modular, self-contained CLI tool.features/rejects/DRY_RUN.md
# features/rejects/DRY_RUN.md
# DRY_RUN

## Overview
This feature introduces a dry-run mode to the CLI tool. When enabled via a new global flag (`--dry-run`), the tool simulates the execution of any command without performing side effects, logging, or invoking external processes. This mode is particularly useful for debugging, testing scripts, and verifying command inputs without modifying state or triggering actions like HTTP calls or file logging.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global flag `--dry-run` that can be used in combination with any other command.
- **Behavior:** When `--dry-run` is active, the CLI will parse and validate command inputs, then produce a structured output indicating what would be executed, including all computed results, potential warnings, and metadata. No external side effects (e.g., file logging, scheduled command execution, HTTP API calls) will occur.
- **Output:** In dry-run mode, the tool will output all computed values and actions in both plain text and JSON modes, mirroring the normal execution output while explicitly stating that this is a simulated run.

## Implementation Details
- **Input Parsing:** The existing input parsing logic is reused. Before invoking the command handler, the tool checks if `--dry-run` is set. If so, it routes the command through a simulation wrapper.
- **Simulation Wrapper:** Each command’s handler is wrapped so that it collects the intended actions and computed results without executing side effects. For example, scheduled executions in TIMER or external API calls in HTTP_API are bypassed with a warning message indicating that these actions would have been executed in a normal run.
- **Diagnostic Output:** The dry-run output includes detailed metadata such as timestamp, version, execution duration (simulated), input echo, and a special flag indicating that the command was not executed for real.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Consistent Reporting:** Validation and error handling are performed as usual, ensuring that users receive the same warnings and errors. However, any operation that would trigger state changes or side effects is instead logged as a simulated action.
- **Fallback:** If a command inherently requires state changes that cannot be simulated, the tool will report this limitation while still processing the remainder of the input.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests should simulate dry-run invocations across different commands (e.g., arithmetic operations, configuration queries, and scheduling commands) to ensure the output correctly indicates a dry-run. Tests must also verify that no external systems are affected during simulation.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples demonstrating dry-run usage:
  - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --dry-run --sum 3 4 5`
  - Document that dry-run mode is meant for testing and validation and does not perform any irreversible actions.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The DRY_RUN feature aligns with the repository’s mission by enhancing the modular, self-contained CLI utility’s usability and safety. By allowing users to simulate command execution, the tool promotes healthy collaboration and reduces risk during development and automation workflows.features/rejects/NOTES_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/NOTES_MANAGER.md
# NOTES_MANAGER

## Overview
The NOTES_MANAGER feature provides a lightweight note‐taking utility that enables users to quickly save, retrieve, update, delete, and now search personal notes stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`). This updated version adds searchable functionality by allowing users to filter notes based on keywords, matching either the note title or its content. This enhancement fosters better organization and recall of important information, aligning with the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined, self-contained utilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Use the global flag `--notes` to activate the notes management module.
- **Sub-Commands:**
  - **add <title> <content>:** Save a new note with a title and content. Optionally, support a comma-separated list of tags appended to the content.
  - **list:** Display a list of note titles with their creation timestamps.
  - **get <title>:** Retrieve and display full details (title, content, creation date, last modified date) of a note by its title.
  - **update <title> <new_content>:** Modify the content (and optionally tags) of an existing note.
  - **remove <title>:** Delete a note by its title.
  - **search <query>:** Search all notes for the provided keyword. The search examines both titles and content, returning any notes that match the query.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Storage:** Notes are stored in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`), with each note record including metadata such as title, content, creation timestamp, and last modified timestamp. Optionally, notes may store a list of tags to facilitate categorization.
- **Input Parsing & Validation:** The CLI parser processes sub-commands and validates that required parameters (e.g., note title and content) are provided. For the search command, it ensures a non-empty query is passed.
- **Search Logic:** The search function reads all stored notes and performs case-insensitive matching against the title and content. Matching notes are returned with brief metadata to assist users in quickly finding their desired notes.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages are provided if a note is not found (for get, update, or remove) or if required parameters are missing. File I/O errors are handled gracefully with appropriate error notifications.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to cover all sub-commands including the new search functionality. Tests should verify that notes are properly added, retrieved, updated, deleted, and that search queries return accurate results.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides to include examples such as:

# features/rejects/SECRETS_MANAGER.md
# SECRETS_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature introduces a secure secrets management utility to the CLI tool. It allows users to add, retrieve, list, and remove sensitive information (such as API keys or passwords) that are stored in an encrypted local file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json). The SECRETS_MANAGER is designed to complement the CONFIG_MANAGER and SECURITY_UTILS features by providing a dedicated mechanism for safe storage, retrieval, and deletion of secrets, thereby reinforcing the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration through secure and modular utility tools.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--secrets` that activates the secrets management module.
- **Sub-Commands:** The following sub-commands should be supported:
  - **add <key> <secret>:** Encrypts and stores the given secret under the provided key.
  - **get <key>:** Retrieves and decrypts the secret corresponding to the key.
  - **list:** Displays a list of stored keys (without revealing the secrets).
  - **remove <key>:** Deletes the stored secret for the specified key.
- The module should prompt for a master password on first use or allow it to be provided through an environment variable (e.g., SECRETS_MASTER) to initialize the encryption mechanism.

## Implementation Details
- **Encryption:** Utilize Node's `crypto` module to perform symmetric encryption and decryption. The master password (or a derived key) is used for encrypting the secrets before storing them in the JSON file.
- **Data File:** The secrets are persisted in a file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json) stored locally. All data written to the file must be encrypted.
- **Operational Flow:**
  - When adding a secret, the module encrypts the secret and saves it under the provided key.
  - When retrieving, the module decrypts the value using the master password.
  - Listing secrets shows only the keys, ensuring sensitive data is not accidentally exposed.
  - Removing a secret deletes the entry from the file.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Validate that the master password is provided or prompt the user accordingly.
- Check for duplicate keys when adding a new secret and warn the user if a key already exists.
- Provide clear error messages for incorrect decryption (e.g., when an incorrect master password is provided), missing keys, or file I/O issues.
- Ensure that sensitive error details are not exposed in logs.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to cover each sub-command (add, get, list, remove) ensuring correct encryption, decryption, and error handling. Tests should simulate scenarios including invalid master passwords and handling of non-existent keys.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets add API_KEY mySecretValue`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets get API_KEY`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets list`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets remove API_KEY`
- Provide inline comments in the source code to explain encryption logic and error management.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SECRETS_MANAGER feature reinforces the repository’s mission by adding secure, modular functionality for handling sensitive configurations. This tool supports healthy collaboration and automation by enabling users to safely manage secrets within a single, self-contained CLI repository.features/rejects/CONVERTER.md
# features/rejects/CONVERTER.md
# OVERVIEW
This feature consolidates various conversion operations into a single, unified CLI command. It merges numeral conversion (between different bases), unit conversion (e.g. temperature and distance), and date conversion (date addition and difference) into one tool. This consolidation simplifies the command structure, reduces redundancy, and aligns with the repository’s mission of providing modular, self-contained automation utilities.

# CLI INTEGRATION
- **Unified Flag:** Introduce a single flag `--convert` to handle all conversion tasks.
- **Mode Selection:**
  - **Numeral Conversion Mode:** When provided with three parameters — a number (as a string), the source base, and the target base — the command validates bases (between 2 and 36) and converts the numeral using built-in JavaScript methods.
  - **Unit Conversion Mode:** When provided with four parameters — a conversion category (e.g. `temp` or `distance`), source unit, target unit, and numeric value — the utility applies the relevant formula (e.g. Celsius to Fahrenheit, meters to kilometers).
  - **Date Conversion Mode:** Supports two sub-modes:
    - **Date Difference:** When provided with two date strings, it calculates the number of days between the dates.
    - **Date Addition:** When provided with a date string and a numeric value, it adds (or subtracts) days to return a new date in ISO format.

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Input Parsing & Validation:** The command dynamically examines the number and type of parameters to select the appropriate conversion mode. It includes robust error handling, offering clear messages if inputs are missing or incorrectly formatted.
- **Output Formatting:** Consistent with global settings, the command outputs results in plain text or JSON (if --json or --json-pretty is active) and includes metadata such as timestamp and execution duration.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests cover all three modes to ensure accurate conversions and error messages. Documentation is updated with examples for numeral, unit, and date conversions.

# ALIGNMENT WITH REPOSITORY MISSION
By merging number, unit, and date conversion functionalities into the CONVERTER feature, the repository enhances usability and reduces complexity. This streamlined utility supports efficient automation workflows and reinforces the mission of healthy collaboration through a modular, single-source file CLI tool.features/rejects/TIME_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/TIME_MANAGER.md
# TIME_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates time utilities and command scheduling into one unified module. In addition to providing standard time and date operations (such as obtaining the current timestamp, date formatting, and calculating differences between timestamps), the module introduces a scheduler that enables users to queue CLI commands for future execution. Schedules can be set for a specific date/time or after a defined duration, with all scheduled commands stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_schedule.json`).

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** A new flag `--time` activates the TIME_MANAGER module, which now supports both time operations and scheduling sub-commands.
- **Sub-Commands for Time Utilities:**
  - **now:** Returns the current timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
  - **format:** Formats a given timestamp using a provided formatting string.
  - **diff:** Calculates the difference between two timestamps.
  - **add/subtract:** Performs arithmetic with timestamps using duration strings (e.g., "1h15m").

- **Sub-Commands for Scheduling:**
  - **schedule add <time> <command> [arguments]:** Schedules a CLI command to be executed at a specified future time or after a specified delay. The `<time>` parameter can be an ISO timestamp or a duration (e.g., "2h30m").
  - **schedule list:** Displays all scheduled commands with their scheduled execution times and unique identifiers.
  - **schedule remove <id>:** Cancels a scheduled command identified by its unique ID.

## Implementation Details
- **Time Operations:** Maintains the existing functionality for time formatting, differences, and arithmetic, utilizing JavaScript's native Date object and optional lightweight libraries if needed.
- **Scheduling Mechanism:**
  - Scheduled commands are stored in a local JSON file (`.repository_schedule.json`) including details such as the command, its arguments, scheduled time, and a generated unique ID.
  - When a scheduled time is reached (or the delay expires), the scheduler invokes the corresponding command using the same command processing logic as the primary CLI.
  - The scheduler operates either in the background (if the CLI is running continuously) or is triggered on-demand to execute due commands.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate scheduling scenarios, including adding, listing, and removing scheduled commands, as well as verifying that commands execute correctly when their scheduled time arrives.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples, such as:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time now`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time format "2023-10-07T12:00:00Z" "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule add "2023-10-07T15:00:00Z" "--sum" 3 4 5`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule list`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule remove 12345`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging time utilities and command scheduling into a single, modular module, TIME_MANAGER enhances automation capabilities and promotes healthy collaboration. Users can not only perform standard time manipulations but also schedule tasks directly through the CLI, thereby streamlining workflows and reducing context switching.
features/rejects/TIMER.md
# features/rejects/TIMER.md
# TIMER with NOTIFICATION & SCHEDULING

## Overview
This update enhances the existing TIMER feature by not only providing a countdown timer with an optional desktop notification, but also by incorporating a scheduled command execution capability. In addition to its primary role of notifying users when a timer expires, the TIMER feature can now be used to trigger subsequent CLI commands automatically. This streamlines workflows by allowing users to schedule follow-up actions without manual intervention, thereby reinforcing the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and practical automation.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flags:** The existing `--timer` flag is retained for setting the countdown duration. The `--notify` flag remains available to trigger a desktop notification (or audible alert) when the countdown ends.
- **New Scheduling Option:** A new optional flag `--schedule` can be appended along with a command string. When provided, the CLI will execute the specified command automatically after the timer reaches zero. For example:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --timer 10 --notify --schedule "--greet"`
    - This command starts a 10-second timer, sends a notification upon expiration, and then automatically runs the `--greet` command.

## Timer Logic, Notification, and Scheduled Execution
- **Timer Countdown:** The CLI accepts a numeric duration (in seconds) and initiates a countdown. It then waits for the specified duration before proceeding.
- **Notification Mechanism:** Upon completion of the countdown:
  - If `--notify` is enabled, the system attempts to trigger a native desktop notification or, if unsupported, displays an alert message in the console (e.g., "Timer finished!").
  - Output modes are supported both in plain text and JSON with metadata updates.
- **Scheduled Command Execution:**
  - **Activation:** When the `--schedule` flag is provided along with a valid CLI command (as a string), after the timer completes and any notification is dispatched, the tool automatically processes the scheduled command using the same CLI logic.
  - **Execution:** The scheduled command is executed in the same runtime environment, and its output is displayed immediately following the timer’s output. If JSON mode is active, the scheduled command’s output is also returned with the usual metadata fields.
  - **Fallback:** If execution of the scheduled command fails or yields an error, an error message is displayed or logged appropriately.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:**
  - The timer duration must be a positive numeric value. If the input is missing or invalid, a standardized error message is generated (e.g., "Error: Invalid timer duration provided.").
  - If the scheduled command string is provided, it is validated to ensure it is not empty.
- **Notification & Scheduling Errors:**
  - Notification failures are caught and reported as warnings without halting the timer’s functionality.
  - Any errors during the execution of the scheduled command are captured, and an error message is displayed, ensuring the tool remains robust.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Tests will simulate timer completion with and without the `--notify` flag, as well as with the new `--schedule` option. Scenarios include successful command execution, failures in scheduled command execution, and proper error handling when inputs are invalid.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README to include examples demonstrating the new scheduling functionality.
  - For instance, document usage patterns such as:
    - `node src/lib/main.js --timer 10 --notify --schedule "--greet"`
    - `node src/lib/main.js --timer 5 --schedule "--sum 4 5"`
  - Inline comments in `src/lib/main.js` are updated to explain the scheduling logic and its integration with existing timer functions.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By integrating scheduled command execution into the TIMER feature, this enhancement further supports automation workflows and reduces the need for manual intervention. It enables users to chain commands in a predictable manner and optimizes the utility of the CLI tool for proactive task management, thus aligning well with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation in a modular, self-contained environment.features/rejects/SELF_UPDATE.md
# features/rejects/SELF_UPDATE.md
# SELF_UPDATE

## Overview
This feature introduces self-update functionality to the repository0 CLI tool. When invoked with the new flag `--self-update`, the tool checks for a newer version available on the npm registry and performs an update if confirmed by the user. This feature ensures users always run the latest version with bug fixes, performance improvements, and new capabilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global CLI flag `--self-update`.
- **Behavior:** When the flag is provided, the CLI will connect to the npm registry (or a defined update endpoint) to retrieve the latest version information for `@xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`.
- **User Interaction:** After fetching the version details, the tool informs the user of the current and latest version. It then either automatically update (if a `--force` flag is provided) or ask for confirmation before proceeding with self-update.

## Implementation Details
- **Version Check:** Use Node's `child_process.exec` or a lightweight HTTP request to query the npm registry for the latest version.
- **Update Mechanism:** If an update is available, execute a system command (e.g., `npm install -g @xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`) to perform the update. This command can run asynchronously and report progress.
- **Feedback & Logging:** The self-update process outputs status messages in both plain text and JSON modes. Metadata such as current version, new version, and update duration is included in the response.

## Error Handling & Testing
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages if the update check fails due to network issues or permission errors while attempting to update. If the CLI does not have sufficient privileges, notify the user with steps to update manually.
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate a successful version check and update, as well as error scenarios. Integration tests should verify the update command is executed correctly in a dry-run mode to avoid unintended changes.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SELF_UPDATE feature reinforces the mission of repository0 by enhancing the maintainability and reliability of the CLI tool. By allowing users to easily keep their tool up-to-date, it promotes healthy collaboration and ensures that everyone benefits from the latest automated improvements without manual intervention.features/rejects/ERROR_HELP.md
# features/rejects/ERROR_HELP.md
# ERROR_HELP & COLOR + I18N

## Overview
The updated ERROR_HELP feature not only provides dynamic, context-aware troubleshooting and color-coded output for improved readability, but it now also integrates internationalization (I18N) support. This enhancement enables error, warning, and help messages to be displayed in multiple languages based on user preference, further reducing friction and promoting healthy collaboration across diverse user bases.

## Internationalization Support
- **Language Configuration:** Users can now specify their preferred language for CLI output via an environment variable (e.g., `CLI_LANGUAGE`). Supported languages include English (`en`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), and additional languages can be added via configuration.
- **Localized Messages:** Error messages, warnings, and troubleshooting hints are mapped via a lightweight dictionary in the source code. If a translation for a specific message is unavailable in the selected language, the system gracefully falls back to English.
- **CLI Flag Integration:** In non-JSON mode, localized messages still appear with ANSI color coding (red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for successes). In JSON mode, the output remains plain but includes a field noting the active language.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Variable:** The new variable `CLI_LANGUAGE` determines the language of output messages. Default value is `en` if the variable is unset or the specified language is unsupported.
- **Dictionary Mapping:** A simple mapping object pairs message keys with translations for each supported language. For example:
  - `ERROR_NO_INPUT`: { en: "Error: No valid numeric inputs provided.", es: "Error: No se proporcionaron entradas numéricas válidas.", fr: "Erreur : Aucune entrée numérique valide fournie." }
- **Integration with Existing Logic:** The helper functions `sendError` and `sendSuccess` are updated to select the appropriate localized message based on the current setting. The existing warning aggregation and ANSI formatting remain unchanged.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests should verify that messages appear in the selected language. Documentation is updated (README and CONTRIBUTING) to instruct users on setting `CLI_LANGUAGE` and adding new translations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By adding internationalization support to ERROR_HELP, the repository further embraces its mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. Users from diverse linguistic backgrounds can now interact with the CLI tool in their native language, lowering barriers and enhancing accessibility.
