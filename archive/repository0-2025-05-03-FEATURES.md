# CLI_HELP Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a command line help functionality which enhances the user experience by providing usage instructions when the --help flag is passed. The feature is integrated into the primary source file (src/lib/main.js) and is documented in the README file. In addition, tests are added to verify that the help output is correctly displayed when invoked.

## Implementation Details
- In src/lib/main.js, update the main function to check if the argument list contains the "--help" flag. If present, print a concise usage guide that includes a summary of available options and brief instructions.
- The help text should be derived from a summary of the README instructions to keep users informed of the repository purpose and how to get started.
- Ensure that the default behavior remains unchanged if the --help flag is absent so that regular execution (console log of input args) works as before.

## Test Enhancements
- Update tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to include a test case that sets process.argv to include the "--help" flag.
- Validate that the printed output contains key usage instructions (for example, command usage and a pointer to the README).

## Documentation Updates
- Update the README.md file to include a section on CLI usage, specifically documenting the --help flag and its output. The updated usage instructions should remain concise and in line with the mission of this repository.
- Mention that this help functionality improves user experience and aligns with the core objective of demonstrating automated workflows and interactive CLI usage.

## Compatibility and Integration
- The changes must remain compliant with Node 20 and ECMAScript Module standards.
- The feature is designed to work within the existing framework of automated testing and CI/CD workflows provided by the repository template.

By introducing this CLI help functionality, users gain immediate access to instructions which enhances usability and aligns with the repository's goal of showcasing valuable CI/CD integrations and features.
