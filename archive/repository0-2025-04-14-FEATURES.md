# ARG_VALIDATION Feature Specification

This feature refines the CLI argument parsing and validation by integrating robust libraries (yargs and zod) to ensure that only supported commands are processed and that any invalid or malformed input is clearly reported to the user.

## Overview

The updated ARG_VALIDATION feature will improve the CLI tool by:
- Replacing the basic argument handling with a structured parser using yargs.
- Defining and enforcing a validation schema with zod to allow only known commands and options.
- Providing descriptive error messages and usage hints when invalid input is detected.
- Maintaining support for all existing commands including `greet`, and preparing the CLI for future commands like `help`, `chat`, `export`, `import`, `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` as documented in other feature specs.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Integrate yargs**: Replace the current if-else branch with a yargs-based parser to handle CLI arguments in a structured manner.
- **Define a Zod Schema**: Use zod to define a schema that strictly allows commands such as `greet`, `help`, `chat`, `export`, `import`, `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update`.
- **Error Handling**: If the input does not match the schema, display a clear error message with guidance on proper usage.
- **Command Routing**: Maintain the current functionality for `greet` while setting up the framework for additional commands in the future.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **Existing Tests Update**: Update tests to account for the new argument parsing and validation behavior.
- **New Test Cases**: Add tests to simulate invalid input, ensuring that errors are properly thrown and that the user is provided with usage hints.

### README File (README.md):
- **Usage Section Update**: Document the improved argument parsing and provide examples of both valid commands (e.g., `greet`, `help`) and error cases when an unknown command is used.
- **Error Messaging**: Explain that in the event of invalid commands, the user will receive a descriptive error message advising on available commands.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No New Dependencies**: The feature uses the already included libraries (yargs and zod) to implement validation.

## Benefits

- **Improved Usability**: Users will receive immediate and clear feedback if they enter an unsupported command or malformed arguments, reducing user error.
- **Enhanced Robustness**: The CLI will process only valid input, which enhances stability and reduces unexpected behavior.

  - `node src/lib/main.js --interactive tutorial`
- **Mode Selection:** When the `tutorial` sub-mode is detected, the CLI will present a series of guided screens with instructions, example commands, and tips on using various sub-commands (such as arithmetic operations, configuration, and security utilities).
- **Fallback Behavior:** If users input an unknown command within the interactive session, the tutorial mode can offer contextual help and suggest usage examples.

## Implementation Details
- **Guided Walkthrough:** The tutorial will run in a text-based format, displaying instructions sequentially. It may include prompts for user input to simulate command execution and provide immediate feedback.
- **Incremental Learning:** The tutorial is structured in sections, each focusing on a set of related commands (e.g., basic math commands, configuration management, and advanced utilities) with a brief description, example commands, and expected output.
- **Integration with REPL:** Users can switch between the guided tutorial and regular REPL mode or exit the tutorial to return to standard interactive sessions.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Robust parsing of sub-commands ensures that users invoking the tutorial mode receive the proper instructional content.
- Any invalid or unsupported inputs during the tutorial sequence trigger informative error messages, directing users back to the main tutorial navigation.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate tutorial mode interactions, verifying that each tutorial screen displays the correct information and that navigation commands work as expected.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated to include examples of launching the tutorial. Inline comments in the source code explain the instructional logic and navigation flow.

It fosters healthy collaboration by reducing the learning curve for new users and ensuring that the tool's powerful functionalities are accessible and well-documented.features/rejects/EXTENSIONS.md
# features/rejects/EXTENSIONS.md
# EXTENSIONS

## Overview
This feature consolidates two auxiliary CLI enhancements into one unified extension module. It merges dynamic plugin loading (formerly provided by the PLUGIN_SYSTEM feature) with shell auto-completion support (formerly provided by the SHELL_COMPLETION feature). This integrated approach not only reduces redundancy by fitting within the 15-feature limit but also enriches the CLI tool by offering customizable functionality extensions and improved user experience through command auto-completion.

## Plugin Integration
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:**
  - The CLI checks for a `plugins/` directory at startup and dynamically imports any `.js` files found there.
  - Each plugin must export a command identifier and a handler function, which are then seamlessly integrated into the CLI command mapping.
  - Loading errors or improperly structured plugins generate warnings without stopping execution.

## Shell Auto-Completion
- **Auto-Generation of Completion Scripts:**
  - A new global flag (e.g., `--completion`) lets users generate auto-completion scripts for popular shells such as Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
  - The CLI dynamically reads its internal command mapping, including all aliases, to produce a tailored completion script based on the user’s shell type.
  - Clear error messages are issued if an unsupported shell is detected or if the user does not provide a valid shell parameter.

## Integration and Benefits
- Consolidates two related extensions into one module to streamline the project and stay under the maximum feature limit.
- Enhances overall CLI usability by enabling both custom plugin support and shell auto-completion, reducing setup overhead for end users.
- Supports healthy collaboration through extensibility and improved productivity, in line with the repository’s mission.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate plugin loading from a temporary directory and validate correct generation of shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples:
  - Plugin example: Place JavaScript modules in the `plugins/` directory to add custom commands.
  - Completion example: `node src/lib/main.js --completion bash > repository_completion.sh`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging dynamic plugin integration and shell auto-completion into a single EXTENSIONS module, this feature reinforces our commitment to modular, self-contained, and user-friendly CLI utilities. This consolidation supports streamlined automation and healthy collaboration while keeping the repository's feature set within ideal limits.features/rejects/CHAT.md
# features/rejects/CHAT.md
# CHAT

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CHAT feature by maintaining an optional conversation context. In addition to the current functionality that sends a single query to the Chat Completions API and displays immediate responses, the feature now supports a multi-turn conversational mode. Users can choose to engage in an interactive session where past messages are preserved and sent along with new queries, yielding more contextually accurate responses.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Addition:** The `--chat` CLI flag remains available. A new optional flag `--context` can be provided to enable conversation mode. When `--context` is active, the session will maintain a conversation history in memory.
- **Interactive Mode:** In context mode, after the initial query is processed, the CLI remains open for further input, displaying a prompt (e.g., `chat>`) for subsequent queries. Users can type new messages which will be appended to the conversation history.
- **Session Termination:** Typing an exit command (such as `exit` or `quit`) will end the conversation and clear the history.

## API Interaction
- **Single Query Mode:** As before, when no conversation context is supplied, the command sends a standalone query to the Chat Completions API, reading the API key from the environment variable `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` and formatting the response appropriately (plain text or JSON with metadata).
- **Contextual Request Handling:** In conversation mode, the API call now includes an array of message objects representing the conversation history along with the latest query. This ensures that responses are generated with awareness of prior exchanges.
- **Response Formatting:** The response is displayed in plain text or JSON, including additional metadata (timestamp, execution duration) in JSON mode. The conversation mode also echoes the previous conversation to help users track context.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:** The command validates that a non-empty query is provided. If no query is given, a standardized error message is output.
- **API Errors:** Network issues or invalid API keys are caught and reported with clear error messages. When in conversation mode, if an error occurs, the session will prompt the user to either fix the issue or exit.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests simulate multi-turn interactions and verify that conversation history is maintained and correctly passed to the API. Both valid and error responses in context mode are tested.
- **Documentation:** Update the README to include usage examples, such as:
  - Single Query Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --chat "What is the weather today?"`
  - Conversation Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --chat --context "Tell me a joke"`, followed by additional inputs at the prompt.
- **Inline Comments:** In `src/lib/main.js`, comments explain the new conversation logic and how the conversation history is managed.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enabling a conversational context, this update enriches the CHAT feature to support interactive, multi-turn dialogues. This improvement promotes a more engaging user experience while reinforcing the mission of healthy collaboration and streamlined automation in a modular, single-file utility.
features/rejects/FILE_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/FILE_MANAGER.md
# Overview
This feature consolidates file handling operations and file watching capabilities into one unified module. FILE_MANAGER provides users with the ability to read, write, append, count, and search file contents, while also monitoring files or directories for changes. This consolidated approach reduces redundancy and streamlines file-based automation tasks, aligning with the repository’s goal of modular and self-contained CLI utilities.

# CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--file` that activates FILE_MANAGER.
- **Sub-Commands for File Operations:**
  - `read <filename>`: Outputs the content of the file.
  - `write <filename> <content>`: Writes (or overwrites) content to the file.
  - `append <filename> <content>`: Appends content to the file.
  - `count <filename>`: Displays counts of lines, words, and characters.
  - `search <filename> <pattern>`: Searches for a regex pattern and returns matching lines.
- **Sub-Commands for File Watching:**
  - `watch <path>`: Monitors a file or directory for changes.
  - `on-change <command>`: Specifies the CLI command(s) to execute when change is detected.
  - Optional flag `--debounce <milliseconds>`: Configures a debounce interval to reduce rapid re-triggering.

# Implementation Details
- **File Operations:** Leverage Node’s built-in `fs` module to perform asynchronous file I/O operations with appropriate error handling for missing files or permission issues.
- **File Watching:** Use `fs.watch` or `fs.watchFile` to detect file system changes. Upon detecting changes, execute the specified command(s) using child process invocation. Incorporate a debounce mechanism to aggregate rapid changes.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear, descriptive error messages and warnings when file operations or monitoring fail, ensuring the CLI remains resilient.
- **Integration:** The feature integrates into the global CLI, respecting global flags (e.g., JSON output mode) and consistent conventions with other modules.

# Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Include tests simulating file operations using temporary files, and file watching events with controlled changes to validate command triggering and debounce functionality.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and inline comments to describe the usage of the FILE_MANAGER including examples like:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --file read ./example.txt`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --file watch ./src --on-change "npm run build" --debounce 500`

# Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging file operations and monitoring in a single, cohesive module, FILE_MANAGER reinforces the repository’s mission of providing streamlined, self-contained CLI utilities that aid in development automation and enhance collaborative workflows.features/rejects/FILE_WATCHER.md
# features/rejects/FILE_WATCHER.md
# FILE_WATCHER

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight file watcher for developers working on repository0. By adding a new CLI flag (`--watch-files`), the repository will monitor key directories (such as `src/` and `tests/`) for changes. When changes are detected, the watcher can automatically trigger actions like re-running tests or notifying the user, thereby improving the development feedback loop and supporting continuous integration and development practices.

## Implementation Details
- **File Monitoring:** Leverage Node.js's built-in `fs.watch` API to monitor changes in designated directories (e.g., `src/` and `tests/`).
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI flag (`--watch-files`) in the main execution file (`src/lib/main.js`). When this flag is provided, the application should initialize the file watcher after processing other CLI arguments.
- **Event Handling:** On file modification, the system should either trigger an automated test run (by invoking a child process that runs tests) or log a message to notify developers. Ensure that the watcher handles common edge cases (e.g., temporary file changes, rapid changes) gracefully.
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate the file watching logic in a single module (e.g., `src/lib/fileWatcher.js`) to keep it self-contained and maintainable.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Implement tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/fileWatcher.test.js`) to simulate file changes and verify that the appropriate events are emitted and handled.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure that the watcher does not consume excessive resources and handles cases such as file deletion or rapid successive changes without crashing.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include a section on the file watcher feature. Provide usage examples, such as:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --watch-files
  ```
- Document how the file watcher works, what directories are monitored by default, and how users can configure or extend the functionality if needed.

This feature supports the repository’s mission by fostering an efficient development environment and facilitating automated feedback, which is essential for maintaining robust CI/CD workflows.features/rejects/CONFIG.md
# features/rejects/CONFIG.md
# CONFIG

## Overview
This feature introduces a centralized configuration management system for repository0. It is designed to load, validate, and manage environment variables and other configuration settings using a simple, consistent API. By leveraging tools such as dotenv and zod, the CONFIG module ensures that all required settings are present and valid, thus supporting robust CI/CD workflows and healthy collaboration.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Loading:**
  - Use the dotenv library to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring that configuration values are initialized before other modules are executed.
  - Provide support for default values, allowing the system to fall back on sensible defaults if certain variables are not defined.

- **Validation:**
  - Integrate zod for schema validation to verify that the loaded configuration adheres to expected types and constraints.
  - If configuration validation fails, the module should exit gracefully with a clear error message and appropriate exit code (as defined in the EXIT_CODES feature).

- **API Design:**
  - Expose a simple, unified API that lets other parts of the application retrieve configuration values.
  - Enable runtime reloading or refreshing of configuration if needed, supporting dynamic changes without restarting the application where possible.

- **Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to initialize the CONFIG module early in the startup process.
  - Ensure that other features such as HTTP_API, LOGGING, and NUMERIC_SAFE can access configuration data using the provided API.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/config.test.js`) to simulate loading of environment variables, validate schema correctness, and verify that default values are applied appropriately.
  - Test edge cases where the `.env` file is missing or contains invalid values.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING:**
  - Update documentation to include instructions on how to use and extend the configuration management module.
  - Provide usage examples and guidelines for setting up the `.env` file with required values.
  - Document how the CONFIG module interacts with other features and its role in supporting the repository’s mission.
features/rejects/LOGGING.md
# features/rejects/LOGGING.md
# Overview
This feature consolidates file-based logging, log rotation, configurable log levels, and automated log cleanup into a unified logging module. In this update, we are enhancing the existing functionality with structured JSON logging output to better integrate with external logging systems and automated monitoring tools.

# Implementation Details
- **File Logging & Rotation:**
  - Activate logging via a CLI flag (e.g. `--log-file <filename>`) to write timestamped log entries in a human-readable format.
  - Implement log rotation so that when a specified file size threshold is reached (configurable via an environment variable), the current log file is archived (renamed with a timestamp or incremental index) and a new log file is started.
  - Support activation via an additional CLI flag (e.g. `--enable-log-rotation`) or through environment configuration.

- **Configurable Log Levels:**
  - Provide a `--log-level <level>` flag where `<level>` can be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR. Ensure that log output respects the configured level for both console and file outputs.

- **Structured JSON Logging:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--json-logs`) that, when enabled, outputs log entries in a structured JSON format. This format will include keys such as timestamp, level, message, and an optional context object.
  - Allow simultaneous support for both plain text and JSON output modes to accommodate various use scenarios (development vs. automated monitoring).

- **Automated Log Cleanup Integration:**
  - Merge log cleanup responsibilities into the unified logging module. Introduce a CLI flag (e.g. `--cleanup-logs`) that triggers a routine to scan the designated log directory for rotated log files.
  - The cleanup process will apply configurable criteria based on maximum file age (e.g. older than 7 days) or a maximum number of log files to retain, with settings provided via environment variables (e.g. `LOG_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE`, `LOG_CLEANUP_MAX_FILES`).

- **Error Handling & Fallback:**
  - Encapsulate all logging functionality in a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/logging.js`) so that any file operation errors or issues with JSON formatting do not interrupt the primary CLI workflow. Fallback to console logging if file-based operations fail.

# Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to confirm that log entries are correctly formatted in both plain text and JSON modes. Simulate scenarios where file rotation should occur, verifying that old log files are archived according to the size threshold.
  - Test the cleanup routine to ensure it deletes expired log files based on age or number limits.
  - Validate that the `--json-logs` flag correctly toggles structured output and that the logs include all intended meta-data (timestamp, level, message, context).

# Documentation
- **Usage Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Activate file logging with rotation and JSON structured logs
  node src/lib/main.js --log-file app.log --enable-log-rotation --log-level INFO --json-logs

  # Run the application and trigger log cleanup
  node src/lib/main.js --cleanup-logs
  ```
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include usage instructions for all logging-related CLI flags (`--log-file`, `--enable-log-rotation`, `--log-level`, `--json-logs`, and `--cleanup-logs`) along with examples and troubleshooting tips.

# Benefits
- **Unified Logging Management:** Combines logging, rotation, cleanup, and structured JSON output into one maintainable module, reducing redundancy.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Provides clear logging output with automatic cleanup and enables integration with external logging aggregators and monitoring systems.
- **User Flexibility:** Offers configurable options that allow users to tailor logging behavior to their project’s needs, ensuring both human-readable and machine-consumable outputs.
features/rejects/CLI_COMMANDS.md
# features/rejects/CLI_COMMANDS.md
# CLI_COMMANDS Feature Update

This update enhances the CLI tool by fully implementing the command routing for the "version" and "update" commands as documented in the existing CLI_COMMANDS feature specification. This update ensures that when a user invokes the CLI with these commands, they receive clear and appropriate responses.

## Overview

The CLI tool currently supports a few commands (greet, gcd, lcm, prime, diagnostics) while unknown commands result in an error message. This feature extends the command routing logic by adding support for:

- **version**: Outputs a message with the current repository version (e.g., "Version: 1.4.1-13").
- **update**: Simulates an update check by printing a message such as "Checking for updates... No updates available".

By adding these commands, the CLI becomes consistent with the documentation and package.json scripts, thereby enhancing the user experience and aligning with the repository's mission to provide handy Node.js CLI utilities.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Command Detection:** Extend the existing command routing logic in the main function to detect the "version" and "update" commands.
- **Version Command:** When the first argument is "version", output the version string. Example:
  ```js
  if (command === "version") {
    console.log("Version: 1.4.1-13");
  }
  ```
- **Update Command:** When the first argument is "update", output a simulated update check message. Example:
  ```js
  else if (command === "update") {
    console.log("Checking for updates... No updates available");
  }
  ```
- Ensure that these new branches integrate seamlessly with the existing routing and error handling logic.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Cases:** Add tests to simulate invoking the CLI with the "version" and "update" commands. Verify that the correct messages are printed.
- Example test case for version:
  ```js
  test("should output correct version", () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation(() => {});
    main(["version"]);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Version: 1.4.1-13");
    spy.mockRestore();
  });
  ```
- Example test case for update:
  ```js
  test("should output update message", () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation(() => {});
    main(["update"]);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Checking for updates... No updates available");
    spy.mockRestore();
  });
  ```

### README File (README.md):
- **Documentation Update:** Add examples in the CLI usage section to demonstrate invoking the "version" and "update" commands.
- Ensure the README reflects that these commands are now supported and explain their outputs.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No Additional Dependencies:** The feature uses existing dependencies. Confirm that the scripts for "version" and "check-update" in package.json remain consistent with the new command implementations.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Functionality:** Users receive immediate, clear output for version and update checks, providing a more complete CLI experience.
- **Improved Consistency:** Aligns the behavior of the CLI tool with the documented features and package.json scripts.
- **User Confidence:** Clear command responses help users understand the state of the application, contributing to a better overall user experience.
features/rejects/DRY_RUN.md
# features/rejects/DRY_RUN.md
# DRY_RUN

## Overview
This feature introduces a dry-run mode to the CLI tool. When enabled via a new global flag (`--dry-run`), the tool simulates the execution of any command without performing side effects, logging, or invoking external processes. This mode is particularly useful for debugging, testing scripts, and verifying command inputs without modifying state or triggering actions like HTTP calls or file logging.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global flag `--dry-run` that can be used in combination with any other command.
- **Behavior:** When `--dry-run` is active, the CLI will parse and validate command inputs, then produce a structured output indicating what would be executed, including all computed results, potential warnings, and metadata. No external side effects (e.g., file logging, scheduled command execution, HTTP API calls) will occur.
- **Output:** In dry-run mode, the tool will output all computed values and actions in both plain text and JSON modes, mirroring the normal execution output while explicitly stating that this is a simulated run.

## Implementation Details
- **Input Parsing:** The existing input parsing logic is reused. Before invoking the command handler, the tool checks if `--dry-run` is set. If so, it routes the command through a simulation wrapper.
- **Simulation Wrapper:** Each command’s handler is wrapped so that it collects the intended actions and computed results without executing side effects. For example, scheduled executions in TIMER or external API calls in HTTP_API are bypassed with a warning message indicating that these actions would have been executed in a normal run.
- **Diagnostic Output:** The dry-run output includes detailed metadata such as timestamp, version, execution duration (simulated), input echo, and a special flag indicating that the command was not executed for real.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Consistent Reporting:** Validation and error handling are performed as usual, ensuring that users receive the same warnings and errors. However, any operation that would trigger state changes or side effects is instead logged as a simulated action.
- **Fallback:** If a command inherently requires state changes that cannot be simulated, the tool will report this limitation while still processing the remainder of the input.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests should simulate dry-run invocations across different commands (e.g., arithmetic operations, configuration queries, and scheduling commands) to ensure the output correctly indicates a dry-run. Tests must also verify that no external systems are affected during simulation.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples demonstrating dry-run usage:
  - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --dry-run --sum 3 4 5`
  - Document that dry-run mode is meant for testing and validation and does not perform any irreversible actions.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The DRY_RUN feature aligns with the repository’s mission by enhancing the modular, self-contained CLI utility’s usability and safety. By allowing users to simulate command execution, the tool promotes healthy collaboration and reduces risk during development and automation workflows.features/rejects/NOTES_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/NOTES_MANAGER.md
# NOTES_MANAGER

## Overview
The NOTES_MANAGER feature provides a lightweight note‐taking utility that enables users to quickly save, retrieve, update, delete, and now search personal notes stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`). This updated version adds searchable functionality by allowing users to filter notes based on keywords, matching either the note title or its content. This enhancement fosters better organization and recall of important information, aligning with the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined, self-contained utilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Use the global flag `--notes` to activate the notes management module.
- **Sub-Commands:**
  - **add <title> <content>:** Save a new note with a title and content. Optionally, support a comma-separated list of tags appended to the content.
  - **list:** Display a list of note titles with their creation timestamps.
  - **get <title>:** Retrieve and display full details (title, content, creation date, last modified date) of a note by its title.
  - **update <title> <new_content>:** Modify the content (and optionally tags) of an existing note.
  - **remove <title>:** Delete a note by its title.
  - **search <query>:** Search all notes for the provided keyword. The search examines both titles and content, returning any notes that match the query.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Storage:** Notes are stored in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`), with each note record including metadata such as title, content, creation timestamp, and last modified timestamp. Optionally, notes may store a list of tags to facilitate categorization.
- **Input Parsing & Validation:** The CLI parser processes sub-commands and validates that required parameters (e.g., note title and content) are provided. For the search command, it ensures a non-empty query is passed.
- **Search Logic:** The search function reads all stored notes and performs case-insensitive matching against the title and content. Matching notes are returned with brief metadata to assist users in quickly finding their desired notes.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages are provided if a note is not found (for get, update, or remove) or if required parameters are missing. File I/O errors are handled gracefully with appropriate error notifications.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to cover all sub-commands including the new search functionality. Tests should verify that notes are properly added, retrieved, updated, deleted, and that search queries return accurate results.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides to include examples such as:
  - Adding a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes add "Meeting" "Discuss project updates, tags:meeting,project"`
  - Listing notes: `node src/lib/main.js --notes list`
  - Retrieving a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes get "Meeting"`
  - Updating a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes update "Meeting" "Discuss timeline and next steps, tags:timeline"`
  - Removing a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes remove "Meeting"`
  - Searching notes: `node src/lib/main.js --notes search "project"`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enabling users to quickly search their notes, the updated NOTES_MANAGER enhances productivity and ease-of-access. This improvement supports agile workflows and fosters healthy collaboration by ensuring that critical documentation and reminders are readily accessible within a single, self-contained CLI tool.features/rejects/SECRETS_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/SECRETS_MANAGER.md
# SECRETS_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature introduces a secure secrets management utility to the CLI tool. It allows users to add, retrieve, list, and remove sensitive information (such as API keys or passwords) that are stored in an encrypted local file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json). The SECRETS_MANAGER is designed to complement the CONFIG_MANAGER and SECURITY_UTILS features by providing a dedicated mechanism for safe storage, retrieval, and deletion of secrets, thereby reinforcing the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration through secure and modular utility tools.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--secrets` that activates the secrets management module.
- **Sub-Commands:** The following sub-commands should be supported:
  - **add <key> <secret>:** Encrypts and stores the given secret under the provided key.
  - **get <key>:** Retrieves and decrypts the secret corresponding to the key.
  - **list:** Displays a list of stored keys (without revealing the secrets).
  - **remove <key>:** Deletes the stored secret for the specified key.
- The module should prompt for a master password on first use or allow it to be provided through an environment variable (e.g., SECRETS_MASTER) to initialize the encryption mechanism.

## Implementation Details
- **Encryption:** Utilize Node's `crypto` module to perform symmetric encryption and decryption. The master password (or a derived key) is used for encrypting the secrets before storing them in the JSON file.
- **Data File:** The secrets are persisted in a file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json) stored locally. All data written to the file must be encrypted.
- **Operational Flow:**
  - When adding a secret, the module encrypts the secret and saves it under the provided key.
  - When retrieving, the module decrypts the value using the master password.
  - Listing secrets shows only the keys, ensuring sensitive data is not accidentally exposed.
  - Removing a secret deletes the entry from the file.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Validate that the master password is provided or prompt the user accordingly.
- Check for duplicate keys when adding a new secret and warn the user if a key already exists.
- Provide clear error messages for incorrect decryption (e.g., when an incorrect master password is provided), missing keys, or file I/O issues.
- Ensure that sensitive error details are not exposed in logs.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to cover each sub-command (add, get, list, remove) ensuring correct encryption, decryption, and error handling. Tests should simulate scenarios including invalid master passwords and handling of non-existent keys.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples:

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SECRETS_MANAGER feature reinforces the repository’s mission by adding secure, modular functionality for handling sensitive configurations. This tool supports healthy collaboration and automation by enabling users to safely manage secrets within a single, self-contained CLI repository.features/rejects/CHAT_SESSION.md
# features/rejects/CHAT_SESSION.md
# CHAT_SESSION Feature Specification

This feature introduces an interactive chat session mode in the CLI tool. It leverages the repository’s support for persistent multi-turn conversation along with optional session titling. When the user invokes the CLI with the "chat" command, the tool will initiate an interactive chat session, where input is read from the terminal and the conversation is stored in the persistent history file (`.chat_history.json`).

## Overview

The CHAT_SESSION feature provides an interactive mode to engage in multi-turn conversations directly via the CLI. It allows a user to start a session with an optional title, follow an interactive prompt, and have all conversation turns be appended to the history file. This enhancement clearly aligns with the repository mission to provide handy CLI utilities while taking advantage of the persistent chat functionality described in package metadata.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- Update the main function to detect if the first argument is "chat".
- When the "chat" command is detected, initialize an interactive session using Node.js’ built-in `readline` module.
- Optionally read a session title from CLI arguments (e.g., `--title="My Session"`) and display it at the start of the session.
- As the user inputs messages, the session will echo acknowledgement and simulate storing the input into the `.chat_history.json` file (for actual persistence, further implementation would be required, but this feature provides the CLI backbone for future enhancements).
- Ensure proper exit when the user types a designated exit command (e.g., `exit` or via CTRL+C).

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- Add tests to simulate invoking the CLI with the "chat" command.
- Since an interactive session may be difficult to simulate fully in unit tests, include tests to verify that the proper prompt message (e.g., "Entering chat session...") is printed when invoking the chat command.
- Mock the readline interface to simulate session termination and input handling.

### README File (README.md):
- Update the documentation with a new section describing the interactive chat session.
- Provide usage examples such as:
    - `node src/lib/main.js chat`
    - `node src/lib/main.js chat --title="Project Discussion"`
- Explain the purpose of the interactive chat mode and its benefits for persistent conversation logging.

### Dependencies (package.json):
- No additional dependencies are required, as the feature uses Node.js’ built-in `readline` module.
- Ensure that any necessary changes to scripts (if any) are minimal and aligned with the current CLI usage.

## Benefits

- Provides an interactive mode for engaging in multi-turn conversations directly in the terminal.
- Enhances user experience by allowing session titling and simulating persistent chat history functionality.
- Aligns with the mission of the repository to deliver handy CLI utilities in Node.js, building upon the existing export and import chat features.
features/rejects/CONVERTER.md
# features/rejects/CONVERTER.md
# OVERVIEW
This feature consolidates various conversion operations into a single, unified CLI command. It merges numeral conversion (between different bases), unit conversion (e.g. temperature and distance), and date conversion (date addition and difference) into one tool. This consolidation simplifies the command structure, reduces redundancy, and aligns with the repository’s mission of providing modular, self-contained automation utilities.

# CLI INTEGRATION
- **Unified Flag:** Introduce a single flag `--convert` to handle all conversion tasks.
- **Mode Selection:**
  - **Numeral Conversion Mode:** When provided with three parameters — a number (as a string), the source base, and the target base — the command validates bases (between 2 and 36) and converts the numeral using built-in JavaScript methods.
  - **Unit Conversion Mode:** When provided with four parameters — a conversion category (e.g. `temp` or `distance`), source unit, target unit, and numeric value — the utility applies the relevant formula (e.g. Celsius to Fahrenheit, meters to kilometers).
  - **Date Conversion Mode:** Supports two sub-modes:
    - **Date Difference:** When provided with two date strings, it calculates the number of days between the dates.
    - **Date Addition:** When provided with a date string and a numeric value, it adds (or subtracts) days to return a new date in ISO format.

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Input Parsing & Validation:** The command dynamically examines the number and type of parameters to select the appropriate conversion mode. It includes robust error handling, offering clear messages if inputs are missing or incorrectly formatted.
- **Output Formatting:** Consistent with global settings, the command outputs results in plain text or JSON (if --json or --json-pretty is active) and includes metadata such as timestamp and execution duration.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests cover all three modes to ensure accurate conversions and error messages. Documentation is updated with examples for numeral, unit, and date conversions.

# ALIGNMENT WITH REPOSITORY MISSION
By merging number, unit, and date conversion functionalities into the CONVERTER feature, the repository enhances usability and reduces complexity. This streamlined utility supports efficient automation workflows and reinforces the mission of healthy collaboration through a modular, single-source file CLI tool.features/rejects/TIME_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/TIME_MANAGER.md
# TIME_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates time utilities and command scheduling into one unified module. In addition to providing standard time and date operations (such as obtaining the current timestamp, date formatting, and calculating differences between timestamps), the module introduces a scheduler that enables users to queue CLI commands for future execution. Schedules can be set for a specific date/time or after a defined duration, with all scheduled commands stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_schedule.json`).

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** A new flag `--time` activates the TIME_MANAGER module, which now supports both time operations and scheduling sub-commands.
- **Sub-Commands for Time Utilities:**
  - **now:** Returns the current timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
  - **format:** Formats a given timestamp using a provided formatting string.
  - **diff:** Calculates the difference between two timestamps.
  - **add/subtract:** Performs arithmetic with timestamps using duration strings (e.g., "1h15m").

- **Sub-Commands for Scheduling:**
  - **schedule add <time> <command> [arguments]:** Schedules a CLI command to be executed at a specified future time or after a specified delay. The `<time>` parameter can be an ISO timestamp or a duration (e.g., "2h30m").
  - **schedule list:** Displays all scheduled commands with their scheduled execution times and unique identifiers.
  - **schedule remove <id>:** Cancels a scheduled command identified by its unique ID.

## Implementation Details
- **Time Operations:** Maintains the existing functionality for time formatting, differences, and arithmetic, utilizing JavaScript's native Date object and optional lightweight libraries if needed.
- **Scheduling Mechanism:**
  - Scheduled commands are stored in a local JSON file (`.repository_schedule.json`) including details such as the command, its arguments, scheduled time, and a generated unique ID.
  - When a scheduled time is reached (or the delay expires), the scheduler invokes the corresponding command using the same command processing logic as the primary CLI.
  - The scheduler operates either in the background (if the CLI is running continuously) or is triggered on-demand to execute due commands.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate scheduling scenarios, including adding, listing, and removing scheduled commands, as well as verifying that commands execute correctly when their scheduled time arrives.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples, such as:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time now`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time format "2023-10-07T12:00:00Z" "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule add "2023-10-07T15:00:00Z" "--sum" 3 4 5`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule list`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --time schedule remove 12345`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging time utilities and command scheduling into a single, modular module, TIME_MANAGER enhances automation capabilities and promotes healthy collaboration. Users can not only perform standard time manipulations but also schedule tasks directly through the CLI, thereby streamlining workflows and reducing context switching.

features/rejects/SELF_UPDATE.md
# features/rejects/SELF_UPDATE.md
# SELF_UPDATE

## Overview
This feature introduces self-update functionality to the repository0 CLI tool. When invoked with the new flag `--self-update`, the tool checks for a newer version available on the npm registry and performs an update if confirmed by the user. This feature ensures users always run the latest version with bug fixes, performance improvements, and new capabilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global CLI flag `--self-update`.
- **Behavior:** When the flag is provided, the CLI will connect to the npm registry (or a defined update endpoint) to retrieve the latest version information for `@xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`.
- **User Interaction:** After fetching the version details, the tool informs the user of the current and latest version. It then either automatically update (if a `--force` flag is provided) or ask for confirmation before proceeding with self-update.

## Implementation Details
- **Version Check:** Use Node's `child_process.exec` or a lightweight HTTP request to query the npm registry for the latest version.
- **Update Mechanism:** If an update is available, execute a system command (e.g., `npm install -g @xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`) to perform the update. This command can run asynchronously and report progress.
- **Feedback & Logging:** The self-update process outputs status messages in both plain text and JSON modes. Metadata such as current version, new version, and update duration is included in the response.

## Error Handling & Testing
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages if the update check fails due to network issues or permission errors while attempting to update. If the CLI does not have sufficient privileges, notify the user with steps to update manually.

# features/rejects/ERROR_HELP.md
# ERROR_HELP & COLOR + I18N

## Overview
The updated ERROR_HELP feature not only provides dynamic, context-aware troubleshooting and color-coded output for improved readability, but it now also integrates internationalization (I18N) support. This enhancement enables error, warning, and help messages to be displayed in multiple languages based on user preference, further reducing friction and promoting healthy collaboration across diverse user bases.

## Internationalization Support
- **Language Configuration:** Users can now specify their preferred language for CLI output via an environment variable (e.g., `CLI_LANGUAGE`). Supported languages include English (`en`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), and additional languages can be added via configuration.
- **Localized Messages:** Error messages, warnings, and troubleshooting hints are mapped via a lightweight dictionary in the source code. If a translation for a specific message is unavailable in the selected language, the system gracefully falls back to English.
- **CLI Flag Integration:** In non-JSON mode, localized messages still appear with ANSI color coding (red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for successes). In JSON mode, the output remains plain but includes a field noting the active language.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Variable:** The new variable `CLI_LANGUAGE` determines the language of output messages. Default value is `en` if the variable is unset or the specified language is unsupported.
- **Dictionary Mapping:** A simple mapping object pairs message keys with translations for each supported language. For example:
  - `ERROR_NO_INPUT`: { en: "Error: No valid numeric inputs provided.", es: "Error: No se proporcionaron entradas numéricas válidas.", fr: "Erreur : Aucune entrée numérique valide fournie." }
- **Integration with Existing Logic:** The helper functions `sendError` and `sendSuccess` are updated to select the appropriate localized message based on the current setting. The existing warning aggregation and ANSI formatting remain unchanged.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests should verify that messages appear in the selected language. Documentation is updated (README and CONTRIBUTING) to instruct users on setting `CLI_LANGUAGE` and adding new translations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By adding internationalization support to ERROR_HELP, the repository further embraces its mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. Users from diverse linguistic backgrounds can now interact with the CLI tool in their native language, lowering barriers and enhancing accessibility.
