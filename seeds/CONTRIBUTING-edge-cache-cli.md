# edge-cache-cli

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **edge-cache-cli**—a forward‑thinking JavaScript library and CLI tool designed to simulate, test, and manage edge caching strategies for modern web applications. Built with Node 20 and ECMAScript Modules, edge-cache-cli helps developers and DevOps engineers mimic CDN behavior locally to optimize caching configurations before deployment.

## Mission Statement

edge-cache-cli bridges the gap between local development and production‑grade edge caching environments. By simulating real‑world caching rules and behaviors, our tool enables teams to experiment with caching strategies, validate performance optimizations, and streamline deployment processes using modern web server libraries and local simulation techniques.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Issues & Suggest Features:**  
   If you encounter bugs or have suggestions for new functionality, please open a GitHub issue with detailed descriptions, configuration examples, or performance metrics.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
   - **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create a branch for your feature or bugfix.
   - **Implement & Test:** Write clean, modular code following our style guidelines, and include both unit and integration tests.
   - **Documentation:** Update usage guides, examples, and this CONTRIBUTING.md file as necessary.
   - **Pull Request:** Submit your pull request and engage in collaborative review.

3. **Enhance the Simulation Engine:**  
   Contribute improvements to our caching simulation—whether by refining algorithms, adding configuration options, or optimizing performance based on real-world CDN behavior.

4. **Improve Documentation:**  
   Help clarify setup instructions, add detailed examples, and document configuration parameters for simulating edge caching scenarios.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**  
  Write clean, maintainable code using modern JavaScript practices (Node 20, ESM). Ensure your changes are well-documented and backward compatible.

- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive tests are crucial. Please add tests that cover new features and edge cases to ensure our simulation accurately reflects expected behaviors.

- **Commit Messages:**  
  Use clear, descriptive commit messages that capture the intent and scope of your changes.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Participate constructively in GitHub issues and pull requests. Your insights and feedback help evolve edge-cache-cli into a powerful local simulation tool.
