# plan-flex-js

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **plan-flex-js**—an innovative JavaScript library and CLI utility for solving complex non‑linear planning problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. plan-flex-js leverages advanced planning techniques, including a target stack approach that combines forward and backward state-space planning, to generate adaptive plans that consider resource constraints, temporal ordering, and incomplete knowledge.

## Mission Statement

plan-flex-js is designed to bridge the gap between cutting‑edge planning research and practical applications in scheduling, robotics, logistics, and beyond. Built with Node 20 and ECMAScript Modules, our framework provides a modular, testable, and extensible solution for developers seeking to implement flexible planning systems capable of handling dynamic real-world challenges.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Issues & Suggest Enhancements:**  
   Open a GitHub issue if you encounter bugs or have ideas for new features. Please include clear reproduction steps, logs, and examples to help us understand the problem.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
   - **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create a dedicated branch for your feature or bugfix.
   - **Coding Standards:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code that adheres to modern JavaScript practices (Node 20, ESM).
   - **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to cover your changes, ensuring that both the CLI and core planning algorithms work as expected.
   - **Documentation:** Update this file and other relevant documentation if your changes impact the planning algorithms or CLI behavior.
   - **Pull Request:** Submit your pull request and actively participate in the code review process.

3. **Enhance Documentation:**  
   Help us improve our guides, API references, and examples to make plan-flex-js accessible to both developers and researchers working on non‑linear planning challenges.

4. **Innovate in Planning Algorithms:**  
   We welcome contributions that explore new planning heuristics, optimize existing algorithms, or extend the framework to handle more complex and dynamic scenarios.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**  
  Write modern, maintainable JavaScript using Node 20 and ESM. Your contributions should be modular, easy to understand, and thoroughly documented.

- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive testing is essential. Please include tests that cover CLI functionality and core algorithm performance under various planning scenarios.

- **Commit Messages:**  
  Use clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose and impact of your changes.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Engage constructively in GitHub issues and pull request reviews. Your feedback and collaboration are crucial to refining plan-flex-js.
