# repository0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **agentic‑lib**! This document outlines our guidelines for human and
automated contributions, ensuring that our core library remains robust, testable, and efficient in powering our reusable
GitHub workflows.

## Mission Statement

`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its
primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows. The source file, test file, README.md and package.json
are maintained by the repository's workflows.

The mission of the contributors is to help people who clone this repository and promote healthy collaboration.

## How to Contribute

Contributions come in many forms—whether you’re a developer, tester, or an advocate for process improvements. Here’s how you can help:

1. **Report Issues or Ideas:**  
   Open an issue on GitHub to share bug reports, feature requests, or any improvements you envision. Clear descriptions and reproducible steps are highly appreciated.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
    - Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
    - Implement your changes, ensuring you follow our coding style and standards.
    - Add tests to cover any new functionality.
    - Update documentation and this file if your changes affect usage or workflow behavior.
    - Submit your pull request for review.

3. **Enhance Automated Workflows:**  
   Contributions might include adjustments to:
    - The AI-based fix verification logic.
    - File update routines responding to build, test, or main output.
    - Logic for extracting issue numbers from branch names.
    - Automated pull request merging or listing mechanisms.

4. **Run and Test the Library:**  
   To explore the capabilities of **agentic‑lib**, run the demo function with:
   ```bash
   npm run start [--help]
   ```
   This command prints a detailed help message, including available functions and parameters.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**  
  Write modular, clean, and fully testable code. Our design intentionally decouples functionality from GitHub Actions globals to enhance testability and reuse.

- **Documentation:**  
  Keep inline comments and this Contributing.md up-to-date as you introduce changes. Clear documentation ensures the project stays accessible to both human and AI collaborators.

- **Compatibility:**  
  Ensure your code runs on Node 20 and adheres to ECMAScript Module (ESM) standards.

- **Feedback & Collaboration:**  
  We welcome constructive feedback. Engage with maintainers and peers through GitHub issues and pull request discussions to improve our collective workflow.

## Issue House Choice Options

repository specific activities:
#- Create, vary or extend as many library functions as you can that deliver the spirit of this CONTRIBUTING.md Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

generic activities:
- Update the source file by applying the Mission Statement to prune any "drift" from the source file. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
- Create, vary or extend as many features in the source file as you can inline with the Mission Statement. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Find anything that might be a "simulated" or "demo" implementation and switch to a real implementation. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Consider alternate code paths that could be explicitly handled to improve the range of supported behaviours. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Look for code that could be simplified using a library and introduce that library. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

undocumented chores:
#- Look for any duplicated code that could be usefully abstracted out to become shared code and implement that abstraction.
- Refresh the README, consulting the guidance in CONTRIBUTING.md while retaining any relevant content and pruning irrelevant content.
- Dry-run any examples in comments or the README against the current code and if they are not accurate or if they could cover more features, update the docs or code to be accurate.
- Bring test coverage up as close to 100% as possible, have single layer mocked tests and deeper tests mocking at the external resource (e.g. file system or network).
- Ensure the main function so that it generates some demo output without an over the wire call, and hint a CLI switch that will do the real call.

# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` These workflows consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` can be modified by the workflow to add or update dependencies and it also defines some of the test and build scripts.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script doesn't drift too far.
  This test file can be modified by the workflow `tests/unit/main.test.js`, duplicate `main.test.js` to fix a version of the behaviour where the workflow can't change it.

- **Docs**  
  This `README.md` can be modified by the workflow.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.

## Should you use the `agentic-lib` Coding System?

* Do you have access to an OpenAI account with necessary API keys?
* Are you willing to incur charges for consumed resources?
* Are you curious about self-evolving code?
* Would you like to see how such a system can be built?
* Do you appreciate integrated OpenAI and GitHub API calls in a JavaScript environment?
