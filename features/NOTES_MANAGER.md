# NOTES_MANAGER

## Overview
The NOTES_MANAGER feature introduces a lightweight note‐taking utility to the CLI tool. Users can quickly save, retrieve, update, and delete personal notes that are stored persistently in a local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`). This feature fosters quick documentation of ideas or reminders directly from the CLI, aligning with the repository’s mission of facilitating healthy collaboration through modular, self-contained utilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** A new global flag `--notes` activates the notes management module.
- **Sub-Commands:** The following operations are supported:
  - **add <title> <content>:** Save a new note with a title and content.
  - **list:** Display a list of note titles with corresponding creation timestamps.
  - **get <title>:** Retrieve and display details of a note by its title.
  - **update <title> <new content>:** Modify the content of an existing note.
  - **remove <title>:** Delete a note by its title.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Storage:** Notes are stored in a locally persisted JSON file (e.g., `.repository_notes.json`). Each note record includes metadata such as title, content, creation date, and last modified timestamp.
- **CLI Parsing:** The notes commands are integrated into the existing command mapping in `src/lib/main.js`. Input parameters are validated to ensure that a title and content are provided where required.
- **Integration with Other Modules:** To maintain the maximum of 15 features in the repository, similar features related to output persistence have been consolidated. Specifically, the EXPORT and HISTORY_LOG features are merged into a unified LOGGING module. This consolidation frees a feature slot for NOTES_MANAGER, ensuring a streamlined and cohesive toolset.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:** Check for duplicate note titles when adding new notes, and confirm the existence of a note before updating or removing it.
- **Error Reporting:** Provide clear error messages on missing or invalid parameters (e.g., missing title or empty content).
- **Persistence Errors:** Handle file I/O errors gracefully by informing the user if the notes file cannot be accessed or updated.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to verify that each sub-command works correctly—for instance, that notes can be added, retrieved, updated, and deleted properly. Ensure edge cases like duplicate titles or non-existent notes are handled appropriately.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples such as:
  - Adding a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes add "Meeting" "Discuss project updates."`
  - Listing notes: `node src/lib/main.js --notes list`
  - Retrieving a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes get "Meeting"`
  - Updating a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes update "Meeting" "Discuss timeline and next steps."`
  - Removing a note: `node src/lib/main.js --notes remove "Meeting"`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By allowing users to quickly jot down and manage notes directly from the CLI, NOTES_MANAGER enhances productivity and collaboration. This feature supports agile workflows and streamlines personal documentation, furthering the repository’s mission to provide practical, modular utilities in a single, self-contained tool.
