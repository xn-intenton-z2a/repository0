# AUTOCOMPLETE

## Overview
This feature introduces command-line auto-completion for the repository's CLI, making it easier for users to discover available commands and flags. When enabled, the CLI can generate completion scripts for popular shells like Bash and Zsh. This aligns with the mission by promoting healthy collaboration and ease-of-use, reducing the friction for new contributors and users.

## Implementation Details
- **Flag Integration:** Introduce a new flag (e.g. `--generate-completion`) in the argument parser within `src/lib/main.js`. When this flag is detected, the application will output a shell-specific auto-completion script.
- **Shell Support:** Provide scripts for at least two popular shells (e.g. Bash and Zsh). The script should be self-contained, allowing users to source it directly in their shell configuration.
- **Module Creation:** Implement the auto-completion functionality in a dedicated module (for example, `src/lib/autocomplete.js`). This module will contain helper functions to identify available CLI flags and commands, and generate the respective script content.
- **Integration:** Update the main CLI execution flow to handle the `--generate-completion` flag. If the flag is present, bypass regular command execution and output the auto-completion script.
- **Error Handling:** Validate the specified shell option (if provided) and return meaningful error messages if an unsupported shell is requested.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests in `tests/unit/autocomplete.test.js` to verify that the auto-completion scripts are correctly generated for supported shells.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that invoking the flag from the CLI (e.g., `node src/lib/main.js --generate-completion bash`) produces the expected output without invoking normal CLI behavior.

## Documentation
- **README Update:** Update the README to include a section on how to use the auto-completion feature and link to the shell-specific instructions.
- **Usage Examples:** Provide examples in the documentation such as:
  ```bash
  # Generate Bash auto-completion script
  node src/lib/main.js --generate-completion bash

  # Generate Zsh auto-completion script
  node src/lib/main.js --generate-completion zsh
  ```
- **Contributing Guidelines:** Update CONTRIBUTING.md to include instructions on writing and testing new shell completion scripts, ensuring consistency with the overall repository style.

This feature is designed to be implemented in a single repository file and complements the existing CLI functionalities by enhancing usability and discoverability.
