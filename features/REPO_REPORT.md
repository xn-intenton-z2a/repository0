# REPO_REPORT

## Overview
This feature merges the functionalities of the previous REPORT_GENERATOR and REPO_INFO features into a single, unified repository reporting tool. REPO_REPORT aggregates diagnostic data, performance metrics, dependency status, and log summaries into one cohesive report. By consolidating these functionalities, the feature simplifies repository insights for developers and CI/CD systems, aligning with the mission to promote healthy collaboration and actionable diagnostics.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a unified flag (e.g. `--repo-report`) which, when invoked, generates a comprehensive report.
  - Support an optional `--json` flag to output the report as a structured JSON object for integration with automated monitoring tools.

- **Data Aggregation:**
  - **Diagnostics & Metrics:** Combine Git information (branch, commit history), repository metadata from `package.json`, and system diagnostics including runtime details and performance metrics.
  - **Log & Dependency Insights:** Collate log summaries, test coverage data, and dependency version information to help identify trends and potential issues.
  - **Report Formatting:** Display the aggregated data in a well-structured plain text format and support HTML/JSON outputs when requested.

- **Modularity & Error Handling:**
  - Encapsulate all functionalities within a single module (e.g. `src/lib/repoReport.js`) to ease maintenance.
  - Integrate robust error handling to gracefully manage missing data or failed API calls.
  
## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to simulate varied repository states and validate that all report sections (diagnostics, metrics, logs, dependencies) are correctly aggregated.
  - Test both plain text and JSON output formats.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure the tool handles scenarios with incomplete data sources gracefully, providing informative placeholders or error messages as needed.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include clear instructions on how to use the `--repo-report` flag and interpret the aggregated repository report.
- Provide usage examples such as:
  ```bash
  # Generate a comprehensive repository report in plain text
  node src/lib/main.js --repo-report
  
  # Generate the report in JSON format for automated processing
  node src/lib/main.js --repo-report --json
  ```

## Benefits
- **Unified Insights:** Combines essential repository metrics into a single report, simplifying diagnostics and enabling proactive monitoring.
- **Streamlined Maintenance:** Reduces redundancy by eliminating separate reporting tools and consolidating their functionalities.
- **Enhanced CI/CD Integration:** Structured output facilitates easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and external monitoring systems.
