# CLI_HELP

## Overview
This feature merges the functionality of shell auto-completion and the cheatsheet reference into one cohesive CLI help module. By consolidating auto-completion script generation and a comprehensive command reference into a single feature, CLI_HELP enhances usability with a unified documentation resource. The feature aids both new and experienced users by providing dynamic command suggestions and a detailed guide of available CLI commands, their aliases, and usage examples.

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--cli-help` to access the unified help module.
- **Sub-Commands/Options:**
  - **Auto-Completion Generation:** When invoked with an argument (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`), CLI_HELP outputs the auto-completion script for the specified shell.
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --cli-help completion bash`
  - **Cheatsheet Display:** With a different option (or no additional argument), CLI_HELP displays a comprehensive cheatsheet that lists all available CLI commands, their aliases, and brief descriptions.
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --cli-help cheatsheet`

## Implementation Details
- **Dynamic Generation:** The module will dynamically extract command definitions from the CLI’s command mapping so that any updates to commands are automatically reflected in both the auto-completion output and the cheatsheet.
- **Auto-Completion Script:** Helper functions will generate shell-specific scripts that integrate with the user’s shell configuration (Bash, Zsh, or Fish). The script includes command aliases and flags in real time to ensure consistency.
- **Cheatsheet Formatting:** The cheatsheet will be provided in both plain text (with a formatted table or bulleted list) and JSON mode (when `--json` or `--json-pretty` is supplied) for machine-readability. 
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages will be shown if an unsupported shell is requested or if the command mapping cannot be accessed.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Tests will verify that both auto-completion scripts and the cheatsheet output include all current CLI commands. They will also check for accurate formatting in plain text and JSON modes.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples on how to use the unified help command. Inline code comments will explain the logic behind dynamic script generation and cheatsheet creation.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging auto-completion and cheatsheet functionalities into the CLI_HELP feature, the repository furthers its mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. This self-contained enhancement simplifies command discovery and usage, reducing learning overhead and improving overall productivity.
