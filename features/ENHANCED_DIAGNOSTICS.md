# Enhanced Diagnostics

This feature extends the existing diagnostics functionality by providing detailed system and environment information when the `--diagnostics` flag is used. It is built to be simple and effective, keeping in line with the repositoryâ€™s template and demonstration goals.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** To output comprehensive diagnostic details including Node.js version, package version, dependency summary, and any relevant environment configuration.
- **Usage:** When the command is executed with the `--diagnostics` flag (i.e. `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`), the application will output extended information beyond the current basic output.

## Implementation Details

- **Command Detection:** Enhance the argument parsing in `src/lib/main.js` to detect the `--diagnostics` flag.
- **System Information:** Retrieve and display system diagnostics such as the current Node.js version, operating system details, and a summary of the key dependency versions from `package.json`.
- **Output Mode:** Format the diagnostic output in JSON for easier parsing, yet also provide a human-readable format.
- **Modularity:** Ensure the enhanced diagnostics functionality is modular and self-contained, so it can be maintained in a single source file without affecting other parts of the repository.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Update or add unit tests in the `tests/unit` folder to verify that when the `--diagnostics` flag is supplied, the output includes the extended diagnostic parameters.
- **Edge Cases:** Include tests to confirm behavior when no arguments or unexpected arguments are provided.

## Documentation

- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guides to include usage instructions and examples for the enhanced diagnostics functionality.
- Reference the mission statement in MISSION.md to emphasize the goal of providing actionable CI/CD insights using this feature.
