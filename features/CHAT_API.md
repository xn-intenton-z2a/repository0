# CHAT_API

## Overview
This feature integrates a Chat Completions API (such as OpenAI's ChatGPT) into the CLI tool. The new command enables users to supply a textual prompt and receive generated content, such as GitHub issue templates or suggestions, directly from the CLI. This tool provides modular automation support and assists in generating actionable feedback for repository improvements, aligning with the repositoryâ€™s mission of promoting healthy collaboration.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new flag `--chat` that triggers the Chat API functionality.
- **Input Parsing:** The command accepts a prompt message as its argument. Optional flags may be added for custom configurations (e.g., `--max-tokens`, `--temperature`).
- **Output Modes:** Support plain text output along with the existing JSON output mode (`--json`, `--json-pretty`).

## Implementation Details
- The module leverages the OpenAI Chat Completions API to process the supplied prompt. It requires the secret `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` for authentication, as noted in the README.
- **Processing Flow:**
  - Read the user prompt from the CLI arguments.
  - Call the Chat Completions API with parameters (prompt, max tokens, temperature, etc.).
  - Capture the API response and format the result for display.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages in case of network issues, missing API keys, or invalid prompt inputs.
- **Integration:** This feature is designed to operate within a single source file (e.g., as an additional module in `src/lib/main.js`), keeping the repository self-contained and aligned with modular CLI design.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests that simulate API calls (using mocks) to verify that valid prompts return the expected output and that errors are handled gracefully.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI help documentation to include usage examples such as:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --chat "Generate an issue template for a bug report"`
  - JSON examples with `--json`.
- **Inline Comments:** Ensure thorough commenting in the source file to assist contributors in understanding integration steps and configuration requirements.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The CHAT_API feature leverages advanced AI capabilities to assist in automation tasks (e.g., generating GitHub issues and suggestions) directly from the CLI. By streamlining content generation and enabling rapid iteration, this module supports healthy collaboration and enhances productivity in a single, self-contained repository.
