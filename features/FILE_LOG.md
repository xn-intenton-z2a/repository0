# FILE_LOG

## Overview
The FILE_LOG feature introduces optional persistent logging of CLI command outputs and metadata to a local file. This feature supplements the in-memory and HTTP-based audit logging already present in HTTP_API, providing a tangible audit trail for users who wish to review command executions after a session. It is especially useful for debugging, compliance, and historical analysis of tool usage.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global flag `--log-file` which accepts a filename (e.g., `--log-file history.log`). When provided, the CLI will append every command’s output—whether success or error—along with metadata to the specified file.
- **Output Augmentation:** In addition to printing results to the console, the tool will write a JSON-formatted log entry to the given file. Each entry includes the command name, result or error, warnings, timestamp, version, execution duration, and input echo.

## Implementation Details
- **Logging Mechanism:**
  - Integrate Node’s built-in `fs` module to handle file operations.
  - On execution of any command (via `sendSuccess` or `sendError`), if the `--log-file` flag is detected, the output is appended to the specified file.
  - The log entries are maintained in JSON format (one per line) to facilitate later parsing and analysis.
- **Error Handling:**
  - If the file cannot be written (e.g., due to permission issues), a clear error message is output to the console, but the CLI command still completes normally.
  - Logging failures are caught silently to avoid interfering with the primary functionality of each command.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to verify that when the `--log-file` flag is provided, a log file is created (or appended to) with correct JSON entries corresponding to the command outputs.
- **Documentation:** Update the README to include usage examples:
  - Example CLI: `node src/lib/main.js --log-file history.log --sum 3 4 5`
  - Detail the structure of log entries and how users can review them.
- **Inline Comments:** Enhance comments in `src/lib/main.js` to explain the file logging logic and error handling related to file I/O operations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
This feature aligns with the repository’s mission by promoting transparency and collaboration through a clear audit trail of CLI interactions. Persistent file logging supports troubleshooting and compliance, ensuring users can retrospectively analyze the execution history of their commands in a modular, self-contained utility.
