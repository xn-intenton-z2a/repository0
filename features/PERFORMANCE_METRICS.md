# Performance Metrics

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight performance monitoring component to the CLI application. The goal is to measure and report runtime performance data such as execution time and memory usage. This aligns with the repositoryâ€™s mission of promoting automated and observable workflows, and provides additional insights during development and CI/CD pipelines.

## Implementation Details
- **Integration:** Enhance the main function in `src/lib/main.js` to capture start and end timestamps. After command execution (regardless of flags), compute the elapsed time.
- **Memory Usage:** Optionally capture memory usage via Node.js process APIs (e.g., `process.memoryUsage()`), and output key metrics.
- **Output Formatting:** Extend diagnostic output in JSON format with a dedicated field for performance data, ensuring human readability as well as machine parsability.
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate the performance metric gathering in a small helper function within the CLI or a single source file module if required.
- **Usage:** The feature can be invoked transparently with existing commands, and enhanced output is available when combined with the `--diagnostics` flag.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Develop tests under the `tests/unit` folder to simulate command execution and validate that performance metrics are recorded correctly without affecting normal functionality.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure that minimal overhead is introduced, and that in scenarios of quick executions, the metrics still report meaningful (or approximate) values.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING:** Update the documentation to include usage examples showing performance metrics alongside diagnostics and version outputs.
- **Examples:** Document invocation using both standard and diagnostic flags. 

## Benefits
- Provides additional context for debugging and optimizing performance in CI/CD environments.
- Enhances system transparency, aligning with the mission of actionable insights and healthy collaboration.
