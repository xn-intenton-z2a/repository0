# AUTO_COMPLETE

## Overview
The AUTO_COMPLETE feature adds shell auto-completion support to the CLI tool. This enhancement generates completion scripts for popular shells such as Bash, Zsh, and Fish. By providing users with auto-completion capabilities, the tool becomes more efficient and user-friendly, reducing command recall errors and speeding up command line interactions.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a global flag `--completion` that accepts an argument specifying the shell type (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`).
- **Usage Examples:**
  - `node src/lib/main.js --completion bash` will output the Bash auto-completion script.
  - `node src/lib/main.js --completion zsh` for Zsh users.
  - `node src/lib/main.js --completion fish` for Fish shell.
- **Integration:** The completion scripts list all available CLI commands (e.g., `--sum`, `--multiply`, `--config`, etc.) dynamically, ensuring that updates in the command set are reflected in the auto-completion output.

## Implementation Details
- **Script Generation:**
  - Implement helper functions within a single source file that generate the appropriate auto-completion script based on the provided shell argument.
  - The script will include definitions for command aliases and flags, mirroring the existing CLI command mapping.
- **Output Instructions:**
  - The tool will print instructions on how to integrate the auto-completion script with the user’s shell (e.g., appending the script to a shell configuration file).
- **Security and Maintainability:**
  - The auto-completion generation logic will be self-contained and easy to update, avoiding external dependencies.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to verify that when the `--completion` flag is invoked with a valid shell argument, the correct script is generated and output.
  - Validate that the script contains all current CLI commands listed in the repository.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI usage guides to include examples and setup instructions for auto-completion.
  - Inline comments will explain the logic behind script generation and how users can integrate the output with their shell environment.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The AUTO_COMPLETE feature supports the repository’s mission of promoting streamlined automation and healthy collaboration. By simplifying command usage and reducing input errors, it enhances overall productivity and creates a smoother user experience for developers interacting with the CLI tool.
