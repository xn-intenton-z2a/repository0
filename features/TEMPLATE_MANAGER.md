# TEMPLATE_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates and enhances the template-related functionalities by merging the existing template validation tool with a new template updating capability. It not only checks for the presence and integrity of key repository files (such as README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, MISSION.md, LICENSE, etc.) as done previously by TEMPLATE_VALIDATOR, but also enables users to update these template files to the latest version fetched from a remote source (e.g. a designated URL from the agentic‑lib repository).

## Implementation Details
- **Validation Functionality:**
  - Retain the existing file existence and minimal integrity checks for essential files.
  - Log clear messages indicating successful validation or pinpointing issues that require attention.

- **Update Functionality:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag `--update-template` in addition to the existing `--validate-template` flag.
  - When invoked with `--update-template`, the module will fetch the latest approved versions of template files from a remote endpoint (configured via environment variables or a fixed URL).
  - Compare fetched versions with the current local files and, if differences are detected, prompt the user for confirmation before updating the files. In automated scenarios, a `--force` flag may bypass the confirmation.
  - Ensure robust error handling and rollback capabilities in case of failed updates, preserving the current state of the repository.

- **Modularity and Maintainability:**
  - Encapsulate the entire logic within a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/templateManager.js`) to keep the functionality self-contained.
  - Provide clear logging using the repository’s logging and diagnostics framework, ensuring that both validation and update operations are easily traceable.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to simulate various repository states (missing files, outdated templates, or correctly updated files) using mocks or temporary file structures.
  - Verify that both validation and update operations behave as expected, including handling forced updates and error scenarios.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include instructions for using both the validation (`--validate-template`) and update (`--update-template`) functionalities.
- Provide usage examples such as:
  ```bash
  # Validate the repository template files
  node src/lib/main.js --validate-template
  
  # Update the repository template files after validation
  node src/lib/main.js --update-template
  
  # Force update without interactive confirmation
  node src/lib/main.js --update-template --force
  ```

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Template Integrity:** Ensures that critical repository files are not only validated but can also be updated to align with the latest standards.
- **Streamlined Maintenance:** Provides a single, unified tool for managing template files, reducing redundancy and simplifying contributor workflows.
- **Support for Automated Workflows:** Facilitates integration into CI/CD pipelines to automate the upkeep of essential documentation and configuration files.
