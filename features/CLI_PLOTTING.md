# CLI_PLOTTING Feature

## Overview
This feature extends the current CLI utility by adding a new command called plot. When users invoke the command with "plot", the CLI will output a sample SVG representation of a mathematical function. This new capability aligns with the repository's mission of providing handy Node.js CLI utilities and enhances user value by offering a visual demonstration of equation plotting.

## Design and Implementation
- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) by adding a new case for the "plot" command in the command switch statement. When triggered, it will display a sample SVG content (for example, a simple quadratic function plot) via console output.
- Extend the test file (tests/unit/main.test.js) by adding a new test case for the plot command. The test will simulate calling main(["plot"]) and will verify that the output contains expected SVG markers (e.g. "<svg") to ensure proper functionality.
- Update the README.md file to include documentation for the new plot command. The command should be explained in the CLI section with usage examples, illustrating its ability to display an SVG plot.
- Adjust dependencies if needed (although core functionality uses native Node.js features) and ensure consistency with existing code style as described in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Impact and Benefits
- Enhances the CLI utility by introducing visual output capabilities.
- Provides users with a new way to interact with the repository that ties into the repository's history of plotting functionality.
- Demonstrates the repository's evolving utility, improving user engagement and showcasing potential for further graphical enhancements.
