# CLI_PARSER

# Description
Enhance the command-line interface to implement build, refresh, and persistence behaviors in addition to parsing and diagnostics. Users can perform staged and enhanced builds, reload configuration, and merge data with persistence.

# Flags and Subcommands
1. --help               Show usage information and exit
2. --diagnostics        Enable diagnostics mode: collect and display system and environment details
3. --serve              Start a simple HTTP server on a configurable port
4. --build-intermediate Perform staged build operations
5. --build-enhanced     Perform enhanced build operations
6. --refresh            Reload configuration and data
7. --merge-persist      Merge data and write results to disk

# Build Operations
## Staged Build (--build-intermediate)
- Read source definitions or configuration
- Generate an intermediate artifact (e.g., JSON manifest)
- Write intermediate artifact to a temporary workspace or stdout
- Log summary of generated items and return

## Enhanced Build (--build-enhanced)
- Starting from intermediate artifact, apply transformations or optimizations
- Produce final build output (e.g., compiled files, bundled results)
- Write output to configured output path or stdout
- Log detailed build report

# Refresh and Persistence
## Refresh (--refresh)
- Load or reload configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON settings)
- Validate and normalize configuration
- Cache loaded settings in memory for subsequent operations
- Log refreshed configuration values

## Merge and Persist (--merge-persist)
- Collect current data sources or previous build artifacts
- Merge entries into a combined data structure
- Serialize merged data to disk at a configurable output file
- Log path and size of persisted file

# Implementation
- In src/lib/main.js:
  - Export functions:
    - performBuildIntermediate(options)
    - performBuildEnhanced(options)
    - refreshConfiguration()
    - mergeAndPersistData(options)
  - In main(): after parsing args:
    - If buildIntermediate: call performBuildIntermediate and exit
    - Else if buildEnhanced: call performBuildEnhanced and exit
    - Else if refresh: call refreshConfiguration and exit
    - Else if mergePersist: call mergeAndPersistData and exit
    - Maintain single-responsibility functions and clear logging

# Testing
- In tests/unit/main.test.js:
  - Add unit tests for each new function:
    * performBuildIntermediate returns expected structure and logs summary
    * performBuildEnhanced applies transformation and logs report
    * refreshConfiguration loads and returns normalized config
    * mergeAndPersistData writes a file and returns file metadata
  - Use spies on console.log and mock file I/O (fs) to isolate behavior
  - Confirm exit codes or returned values when flags selected

# Documentation
- Update README.md under **Build Operations**:
  - Describe usage of --build-intermediate and --build-enhanced
  - Provide inline examples:
    npm run build-intermediate
    npm run build-enhanced
- Add **Data Management** section:
  - Explain --refresh and --merge-persist behaviors
  - Show examples:
    npm run refresh
    npm run merge-persist
