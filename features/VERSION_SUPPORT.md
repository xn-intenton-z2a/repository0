# Overview
This feature extends the CLI functionality to include comprehensive version reporting and diagnostics. Users can run the application with the --version flag to view the current application version along with a timestamp, and with the --diagnostics flag to obtain detailed information about the Node.js runtime and system environment.

# Implementation
- In src/lib/main.js, update the main function to handle two new CLI flags:
  - When the --version flag is detected:
    - Dynamically import the package.json file to retrieve the version information.
    - Retrieve the current timestamp using the Date object.
    - Output a message combining the application version and the current timestamp.
  - When the --diagnostics flag is detected:
    - Capture environment details such as process.version for Node.js version and process.platform for the operating system.
    - Output a formatted report containing these diagnostics details.
- Ensure that this update integrates seamlessly with the existing CLI functionality, without breaking features such as the dynamic help message (--help) and CLI utilities output (via --cli-utils).
- In tests/unit/main.test.js, add or update test cases to simulate running the CLI with --version and --diagnostics flags. The tests should verify that:
  - For --version, the output contains the package version and a valid timestamp.
  - For --diagnostics, the output includes the required Node.js version and platform information.
- Update the README.md and docs/USAGE.md documentation to include details about these new flags, explaining how to use them and what output to expect.

# Impact
- This update delivers high-impact core functionality by providing transparent versioning and diagnostics information. 
- It improves troubleshooting and ensures that users have immediate access to essential debug data, aligning with the repository's mission to offer robust CLI utilities.
- The changes maintain backward compatibility while expanding the CLIâ€™s usefulness in both development and production environments.
