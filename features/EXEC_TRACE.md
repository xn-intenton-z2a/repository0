# EXEC_TRACE

## Overview

The EXEC_TRACE feature introduces a detailed execution tracing mechanism for the CLI application. When enabled via the `--trace` flag, the application will log internal execution steps, decision points, and module invocations. This trace is invaluable for debugging, troubleshooting execution flows, and understanding the order of operations, thereby enhancing the repositoryâ€™s diagnostic capabilities in line with the mission of providing actionable insights for collaboration and CI/CD automation.

## Implementation Details

- **Flag Integration:**
  - Add a new CLI flag `--trace` in the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js`.
  - When the flag is provided, enable detailed trace logging throughout the application execution.

- **Trace Logging Module:**
  - Create a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/execTrace.js`) that provides functions to log timestamped execution events.
  - Ensure that trace logs include key events such as start of argument parsing, configuration loading, module invocations, and completion steps.
  - The module should format logs consistently and allow for easy inspection (optionally to the console or a separate log file).

- **Modularity and Non-Intrusiveness:**
  - Integrate the tracing mechanism such that it augments existing features without interfering with normal execution.
  - Maintain performance by ensuring that tracing is only active when the `--trace` flag is enabled.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Include tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/execTrace.test.js`) to verify that when the `--trace` flag is used, trace events are correctly logged.
  - Simulate CLI invocations and check the sequence and content of logged events.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Validate that enabling trace mode does not impact the exit codes or overall application performance when disabled.
  - Test that log output does not interfere with other console outputs.

## Documentation

- **Usage Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Run the CLI with execution tracing enabled
  node src/lib/main.js --trace
  ```
- **README and CONTRIBUTING Updates:**
  - Update documentation to include information on the `--trace` flag, its purpose, and how to interpret the output.
  - Provide guidance on enabling and disabling trace logs for troubleshooting purposes.
