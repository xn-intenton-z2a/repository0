# SPARKLINE

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI command `--sparkline` that generates an ASCII sparkline based on a series of numeric inputs. The sparkline provides a quick visual representation of data trends directly from the command line. This addition enhances the CLI tool with lightweight data visualization capabilities, aligning with the repository's mission of providing practical and modular utilities to aid in diagnostics and automation.

## Implementation Details
- **Command Integration:**
  - Add a new flag `--sparkline` to the command mapping in `src/lib/main.js`.
  - The command should accept a list of numeric inputs which represent a dataset.
  
- **Sparkline Generation:**
  - Parse numeric inputs using the existing helper (`parseNumbers`).
  - Validate that a minimum number of data points are provided (at least 2).
  - Map the numeric values to a set of Unicode block characters (or a simple character set such as `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`) to produce a sparkline string.
  - Handle edge cases where all numbers are the same, in which a flat line is displayed.

- **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - If no valid numbers are provided, issue a standardized error message: "Error: No valid numeric inputs provided.".
  - Provide clear and concise error messages if inputs cannot form a valid dataset for sparkline generation.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to confirm that valid datasets yield correct and proportionate sparkline output.
  - Verify error handling when inputs are incorrect or missing.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI usage documentation to include examples:
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --sparkline 3 5 9 12 7 5`
  - Add inline comments in `src/lib/main.js` where the new command is integrated to explain the sparkline computation logic.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SPARKLINE feature reinforces the repository’s dedication to providing simple, modular, and practical tools. By enabling quick visual gaps in datasets directly from the CLI, this feature fosters better diagnostics, encourages healthy collaboration, and promotes the utility of minimal code solutions in automation workflows.
