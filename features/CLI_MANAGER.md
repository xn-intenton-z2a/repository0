# CLI_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates the functionalities of CLI interactive improvements and robust argument parsing into a single module called CLI_MANAGER. It merges dynamic command suggestions, history search, and interactive session management with structured command-line argument validation and routing. By unifying these aspects, the repository reduces redundancy and streamlines CLI operations, supporting the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and efficient CI/CD workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized CLI Processing:**
  - Merge the interactive session capabilities (e.g., real-time command suggestions, command history, REPL experience) with structured flag parsing and validation.
  - Leverage Node.js’s readline module alongside libraries like Zod for schema validation to ensure accurate interpretation of CLI flags and dynamic auto-completion.
- **Unified Command Management:**
  - Integrate flag parsing, alias resolution, and error messaging into one central module. All CLI commands will now be routed through CLI_MANAGER, ensuring consistency in help outputs and error handling.
  - Provide interactive prompts that match the output of conventional CLI help flags, including context-sensitive suggestions and historical command recall.
- **Integration and Modularity:**
  - Implement the consolidated logic in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/cliManager.js`) that replaces the separate modules for interactive CLI and argument parsing.
  - Ensure full backward compatibility by supporting all existing commands and extending them where necessary.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to simulate different CLI inputs and interactive sessions. Verify that suggestions, history search, auto-completion, and command validations work seamlessly together.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Validate behavior for missing or malformed commands, ensuring that the unified module provides clear, actionable error messages without disrupting the interactive flow.

## Documentation
- **README & CONTRIBUTING Updates:**
  - Update documentation with usage examples covering interactive sessions, auto-completion, and command-line flag behavior.
  - Provide examples to show how existing CLI commands are now handled by the unified CLI_MANAGER module.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a more responsive and intuitive CLI by combining real-time interactivity with robust parsing and error handling.
- **Streamlined Maintenance:** Centralizes CLI functionality into one module, reducing code duplication and simplifying future enhancements.
- **Consistency:** Ensures uniform behavior and messaging across all CLI operations, aligning with the repository’s emphasis on actionable diagnostics for CI/CD workflows.
