# CLI_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates all aspects of the command-line interface into a single, unified module. It merges interactive improvements (such as real-time command suggestions, history search, and auto-completion) with robust argument parsing and routing. Additionally, this update integrates usage analytics directly within the CLI, capturing command frequency and user interaction data. By unifying these functionalities, the repository reduces code duplication, streamlines CL interface operations, and provides actionable insights to optimize the user experience.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized CLI Processing:**
  - Merge interactive session capabilities (real-time suggestions, command history, REPL-like features) with structured flag parsing using libraries such as Node.js's readline and Zod for schema validation.
  - Route all commands through a single module (`src/lib/cliManager.js`) to ensure consistency in help outputs, error handling, and interactive prompt behavior.

- **Usage Analytics Integration:**
  - Integrate analytics logic within the CLI manager to intercept and log every command execution along with timestamps and arguments.
  - Store analytics data in a JSON file (e.g. `usage.json`) that tracks frequency and recency of commands, replacing the separate USAGE_ANALYTICS module.
  - Provide a CLI flag (e.g. `--usage-analytics`) to display a summary report of command usage in both human-readable and JSON formats.

- **Error Handling and Backward Compatibility:**
  - Ensure that enhancements in auto-completion and usage tracking do not interfere with existing CLI operations.
  - Maintain robust error messaging for invalid or malformed commands, with clear guidance for user correction.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simulate various CLI inputs (both interactive and scripted) to validate that suggestions, history retrieval, and auto-completion work seamlessly.
  - Verify that command executions are correctly logged in `usage.json` and that the analytics report accurately reflects command usage.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test scenarios with missing or corrupted analytics data files and ensure graceful degradation (e.g. in-memory logging fallback).
  - Validate behavior when users input unexpected commands or use unsupported flags.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents with new usage examples demonstrating interactive sessions, command auto-completion, and usage analytics reporting (via the `--usage-analytics` flag).
- Provide detailed API references for the CLI manager functions, including configuration options and customization of analytics data capture.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience:** By combining interactive CLI improvements with usage tracking, users receive a more intuitive and responsive command-line interface.
- **Streamlined Maintenance:** Centralizes functionality into one module, reducing redundancy and simplifying future feature enhancements.
- **Actionable Insights:** Usage analytics integrated within the CLI help maintainers understand command usage patterns, enabling data-driven improvements.
