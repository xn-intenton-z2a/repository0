# CACHE

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight caching mechanism to store the results of expensive CLI operations such as changelog generation, diagnostics retrieval, or HTTP API responses. By caching frequent computations, the repository improves performance and responsiveness, especially during repetitive tasks invoked by automated workflows or user interactions.

## Implementation Details
- **Cache Storage:**
  - Implement a simple file-based cache using Node.js built-in modules (e.g. `fs` and `path`).
  - Store cache data in a designated file (e.g. `cache.json`) at the repository root.
  - Include cache metadata such as creation timestamp and expiration duration.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Add a new CLI flag (e.g. `--use-cache`) to enable reading from and writing to the cache.
  - Integrate caching in operations that are computationally expensive, such as generating a changelog or retrieving diagnostics data.
  - Ensure that cache entries expire based on a configurable duration to avoid stale data.

- **Error Handling & Fallback:**
  - Incorporate robust error handling to gracefully continue operation if cache reading or writing fails.
  - Fall back to normal operation without caching when encountering any issues to guarantee reliability.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g. in `tests/unit/cache.test.js`) to simulate caching behavior, including creation, retrieval, expiration, and error conditions.
  - Verify that enabling the `--use-cache` flag returns cached responses when valid, and bypasses caching on errors.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that race conditions or concurrent writes are handled safely (if applicable).
  - Test behavior with corrupted or unreadable cache files to ensure meaningful error messages and safe fallbacks.

## Documentation
- **Usage Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Use cached results for repeated operations
  node src/lib/main.js --use-cache
  ```
- Update README and CONTRIBUTING to include details about the caching mechanism and instructions for clearing or refreshing the cache manually.

## Benefits
- **Performance Improvements:** By caching expensive operations, users experience faster execution of frequently used commands.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Reduces redundant computations, leading to lower CPU and disk usage during automated workflows.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a smoother and more responsive CLI, particularly beneficial in CI/CD and development environments.
