# INTERACTIVE REPL & BATCH

## Overview
The INTERACTIVE feature has been enhanced to include not only an interactive read-eval-print loop (REPL) but also a batch processing mode. Users can now launch an interactive session to experiment with commands in real time, or process a file containing a series of CLI commands, executing them sequentially. This extension streamlines both exploratory command execution and automation of pre-defined command sequences, reinforcing the repository's mission of providing modular, self-contained utilities for healthy collaboration and efficient workflow automation.

## CLI Integration
- **Interactive Mode:** Invoked using the `--interactive` (or `--repl`) flag, this mode launches a REPL session using Node's readline module. Users can enter commands, see immediate feedback, and request help for available operations.
- **Batch Mode:** A new sub-mode activated via the `--batch <filepath>` flag allows users to specify a text file containing CLI commands (one per line). The tool reads the file, processes each command sequentially, and outputs results either immediately or as a summarized report.
- **Global Flags Compatibility:** Both modes support global flags such as `--json`/`--json-pretty` for output formatting and `--summarize-warnings` to aggregate duplicate warnings.

## Implementation Details
- **REPL Enhancements:** The interactive session continues as previously implemented with enhanced inline help and error reporting. Commands entered are parsed using the existing command mapping, ensuring consistency with non-interactive CLI usage.
- **Batch Processing:**
  - When the `--batch` flag is provided with a valid file path, the CLI reads commands line by line. Each line is treated as a separate command string, parsed into arguments, and executed using the same core logic as direct CLI invocations.
  - The system logs the outcome of each command (success, error, and any warnings) and, if in JSON output mode, aggregates the results into a comprehensive JSON object that includes individual command responses along with execution metadata.
  - Error handling includes file I/O checks (e.g., missing file, read permission errors) and proper reporting of any command-specific errors encountered during batch execution.
- **Integration with Existing Logic:**
  - Reuse of the central parsing and command processing functions ensures that both interactive and batch modes behave consistently.
  - The enhanced modes also integrate with features such as debug logging, configuration display, and dynamic adjustments to global flags (e.g., JSON mode) as defined in the main CLI logic.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate batch file processing by creating temporary command files and verifying that each line is executed in order. Existing REPL tests will be updated to confirm the behavior of the interactive session remains unchanged.
- **Integration Tests:** Automated tests will run a batch file containing a variety of commands (including both valid and invalid inputs), ensuring that output aggregation, error reporting, and metadata inclusion work as expected.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples:
  - Interactive mode: `node src/lib/main.js --interactive`
  - Batch mode: `node src/lib/main.js --batch commands.txt`
  - Example batch file content will also be provided to illustrate the format and expected behavior.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging batch processing capabilities into the INTERACTIVE feature, users gain a versatile tool that supports both exploratory usage and automated, file-driven command execution. This enhancement supports streamlined workflows and fosters healthy collaboration by reducing context switching and enabling robust automation in a single, self-contained CLI repository.
