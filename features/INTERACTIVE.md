# INTERACTIVE Mode Enhancement

## Overview
This update enhances the existing interactive REPL mode of the CLI tool by adding command auto-completion and inline suggestion features. Users not only benefit from a persistent session to execute commands in real-time but now also receive dynamic command suggestions based on the available CLI commands. This improvement makes the system more user-friendly and promotes exploration of the tool's capabilities in accordance with our mission of fostering healthy collaboration.

## Implementation Details
- **Activation:**
  - The interactive mode is triggered via the `--interactive` flag. When activated, the CLI enters a REPL loop, displaying a prompt (e.g., `repository0> `) where users can input commands.
  
- **Command Parsing and Execution:**
  - Reuse the existing command parsing logic from `src/lib/main.js` to support all available arithmetic, statistical, and configuration commands.
  - In addition to processing commands, the interactive mode now integrates an auto-completion feature. As users type, the system suggests command names and available flags based on the current input context.

- **Auto-Completion & Suggestions:**
  - Leverage Node's built-in `readline` module to set up an auto-completion callback.
  - The auto-completion function scans the complete list of commands (both long and alias forms such as `--sum`, `-s`, etc.) and provides suggestions in real-time.
  - Display inline hints or a drop-down list of possible commands for quick selection.

- **User Experience:**
  - Provide clear visual feedback in the prompt with possible completions when the Tab key is pressed.
  - Maintain a session history (in-memory) that records all successfully executed commands and can be navigated via up/down arrow keys.
  - Support commands like `exit` or `quit` to gracefully end the session.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Validate user inputs in real-time and highlight errors if the input does not match known commands.
- If an invalid command is entered, the system suggests similar valid commands.
- Ensure that errors in the auto-completion logic do not interrupt the REPL session; fallback to basic input if needed.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests that simulate the interactive session, including tests for auto-completion and suggestion functionality.
  - Validate that suggestions are accurate and that the REPL mode remains stable under various input scenarios.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and interactive mode documentation to include examples of how auto-completion works (e.g., pressing Tab to view available commands).
  - Inline comments in `src/lib/main.js` should document changes to the interactive loop and auto-completion logic.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
This enhancement improves usability and accessibility of the CLI tool. By incorporating dynamic command suggestions into the interactive REPL mode, users can more easily discover and understand the wide range of CLI functionalities, reinforcing the repositoryâ€™s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined workflows.
