# INTERACTIVE_TOOLS

## Overview
This feature enhances the interactive capabilities of the CLI by merging several interactive enhancements into a single, cohesive module. In addition to the previously merged functionalities (REPL mode and unified trace/output formatting), this update introduces a customizable startup banner that displays key repository details (name, version, and mission tagline) when the CLI is launched interactively.

## REPL Mode
- **CLI Flag:** Activates an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) using Node.js’s built-in `readline` module.
- **Interactive Session:** Allows users to continuously enter and execute commands, with immediate visual feedback.
- **Command Integration:** Leverages existing CLI functionalities (such as help, diagnostics, and project initialization) for a seamless interactive experience.

## Unified Trace and Output Formatting
- **Trace Logging:** When the `--trace` flag is active, detailed trace logs capture key execution events with optional color-enhanced output.
- **Output Formatting:** Processes all CLI messages, error logs, and diagnostics through a unified formatting module, ensuring consistent display across operations.

## Banner Display
- **Purpose:** Enhances user experience by presenting a stylized banner on startup that includes the repository name, current version (from `package.json`), and a brief inspirational message aligned with the repository’s mission.
- **Configuration:**
  - The banner is shown by default in interactive mode. 
  - A CLI flag (e.g. `--no-banner`) allows users to disable the display if preferred.
- **Implementation:**
  - Encapsulated within the same module, the banner is rendered using simple ASCII art and dynamic data retrieval (version info, mission tagline) directly from the repository files.
  - Designed to run as a lightweight addition that does not interfere with standard CLI operations.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Simulate interactive sessions to verify that the REPL processes commands as expected. Test that the startup banner renders correctly under default settings and is suppressed when `--no-banner` is provided.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that combining the banner display with unified trace output and REPL mode does not impact performance or user experience, even under rapid command input.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Engagement:** Provides immediate context and branding through the startup banner, helping new contributors quickly recognize the repository’s identity and mission.
- **Streamlined Interactivity:** By consolidating REPL, trace logging, output formatting, and banner display into one module, maintenance is simplified and user interactions are more cohesive.
- **Customizability:** Offers flexible configuration for both novice and advanced users, improving the accessibility and professionalism of the CLI tool.
