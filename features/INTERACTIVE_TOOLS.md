# Interactive Tools

## Overview
This feature introduces a set of interactive enhancements that streamline how users engage with the CLI. It merges two previously separate functionalities into one cohesive module:

1. **REPL Mode:** An interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop that allows users to experiment with CLI commands in real time. This mode provides immediate feedback, enabling dynamic troubleshooting, testing, and exploration of repository features.

2. **Unified Trace and Output Formatting (TRACE_OUTPUT):** Combines detailed execution tracing and flexible output formatting into a single, maintainable module. With this merger, users benefit from consistent, color-enhanced outputs and trace logs that capture key execution events.

## Implementation Details

### REPL Mode
- **CLI Flag:** Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--repl`) that, when provided, starts an interactive shell using Node.jsâ€™s built-in `readline` module.
- **Interactive Session:** Once activated, the REPL will continuously accept and evaluate user commands, providing dynamic responses and immediate visual feedback.
- **Command Integration:** REPL will leverage existing CLI functionalities (like help, diagnostics, and project initialization) so users can mimic standard execution flows in an interactive environment.

### Unified Trace and Output Formatting (TRACE_OUTPUT)
- **Consolidation:** Merge the functionalities of the previous EXEC_TRACE and OUTPUT_FORMAT features into one module. This module will handle detailed trace logging when the `--trace` flag is active, as well as unified output formatting based on CLI flags (e.g. `--output-format json`, `--color`, `--strip-punctuation`).
- **Output Consistency:** Ensure that all CLI messages, error logs, and diagnostics are processed through the unified module, ensuring consistent metadata, color coding, and trace information.
- **Performance:** Tracing and formatting operations will be optimized to activate only when explicitly requested to avoid interfering with normal CLI execution.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Develop tests to simulate interactive REPL sessions by feeding predefined commands and verifying expected responses. Also, create tests to ensure that trace logs capture all key execution steps and that output formatting adheres to flag configurations.

- **Edge Cases:** Test for graceful handling of unexpected inputs in the REPL, and ensure that enabling unified trace and output features does not impact application performance or disrupt normal execution flows.

## Documentation

- **User Guides:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include instructions on invoking the REPL mode (e.g. `node src/lib/main.js --repl`) and examples demonstrating its capabilities.
- **CLI Help:** Enhance the `--help` output to include descriptions for the new `--repl`, `--trace`, and output formatting flags.
- **Developer Guidelines:** Document the merged TRACE_OUTPUT module structure to assist future enhancements and maintain consistency.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Interactivity:** Offers users a hands-on environment for learning, debugging, and experimenting with CLI commands in real time.
- **Consistent Diagnostics:** Provides a unified, easy-to-read output that combines detailed execution tracing with flexible formatting options.
- **Streamlined Maintenance:** By merging similar functionalities (EXEC_TRACE and OUTPUT_FORMAT), the repository reduces redundancy and simplifies future development and troubleshooting.
