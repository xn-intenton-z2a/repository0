# CONFIG_HANDLER

## Overview
This feature consolidates environment configuration management into a single, unified module. It combines the responsibilities of loading configuration from a `.env` file at startup (previously handled by CONFIG_LOADER) and dynamically watching for changes in the configuration file (previously handled by CONFIG_WATCHER). The new CONFIG_HANDLER ensures that any updates to the environment variables are automatically reloaded at runtime, minimizing downtime and supporting automated, reproducible workflows as described in the repositoryâ€™s mission.

## Implementation Details
- **Initialization:**
  - At application startup, load environment variables using the `dotenv` package.
  - Optionally validate the loaded configuration using a schema validator (e.g. with `zod`).
- **Dynamic Reloading:**
  - Use Node.js's `fs.watch` API to monitor the `.env` file for changes. When a modification is detected, automatically reload the configuration.
  - Emit events or notifications to update dependent modules if necessary.
- **Integration:**
  - Integrate the new module into the main CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) so that configuration is loaded and watched prior to processing any CLI arguments.
  - Ensure graceful error handling if the `.env` file is missing, unreadable, or fails validation.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simulate scenarios where the `.env` file is updated during runtime and verify that the new configuration values are correctly loaded.
  - Test handling of edge cases, such as file access errors or invalid configuration content.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include a section on dynamic configuration management.
- Provide usage examples and instructions on how to enable dynamic config reloading (e.g., via a CLI flag `--watch-config` that now activates CONFIG_HANDLER functionality).
- Explain the benefits of having a single module for managing configuration, ensuring consistency and reducing maintenance overhead.
