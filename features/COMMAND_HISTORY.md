# COMMAND_HISTORY

## Overview
This feature introduces a command history tracking mechanism for repository0â€™s CLI. It records each executed command along with a timestamp, allowing users to review, repeat, and debug previous invocations. This aligns with our mission by enhancing developer productivity and supporting reproducible workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **History Storage:**
  - Create a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/commandHistory.js`) that manages a JSON file (e.g., `history.json`) at the project root.
  - Each CLI invocation appends an entry with the executed command, its arguments, and a timestamp.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Integrate the command history module into the main execution flow in `src/lib/main.js` so that, after processing commands, an entry is recorded.
  - Optionally introduce a new flag (e.g., `--show-history`) to display the stored command history to the user.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensure that any failure to write to or read from the history file does not interrupt the main CLI functionality.
  - Provide fallback mechanisms such as in-memory history buffering if file access fails.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop tests to simulate different CLI invocations and verify that appropriate history entries are created in the JSON file.
  - Test the retrieval functionality using the `--show-history` flag.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Verify behavior when the history file is missing, corrupted, or has limited write permissions.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to include:
  - Usage examples for recording and displaying command history.
  - Clear guidelines on how the history file is structured and managed.

## Integration Note
To maintain a streamlined feature set (maximum 15 features), we propose merging the two related configuration features (`CONFIG_HANDLER` and `SETTINGS`) into a single unified feature called `CONFIG`. This consolidation reduces redundancy while preserving all functionality related to configuration management.
