# COMMAND_HISTORY Enhancement

This update extends the existing COMMAND_HISTORY feature to provide advanced history management capabilities. In addition to logging and clearing CLI commands, new subcommands allow users to search, filter, and export their command history in structured JSON format. This enhancement is designed to further improve diagnostics and traceability in automated workflows while aligning with the repository's mission of promoting healthy collaboration.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Enhance the command history functionality by introducing search and export capabilities. Users will not only be able to view and clear history but also filter it by keyword and export the log as structured JSON data.
- **Scope:** This feature update introduces two additional CLI flags:
  - `--search-history <keyword>`: Filters the command history based on a provided keyword. The search will match against command names and input parameters stored in the history records.
  - `--export-history`: Exports the entire command history to a JSON file (e.g., `history.json`) for further analysis.

## Implementation Details

- **Integration:**
  - Extend the existing functionality in `src/lib/main.js` where the command history is managed. The history is stored in a text file (`history.log`) in JSON lines format.
  - For `--search-history`, read and parse the log file, then apply a filter based on the user-supplied keyword. Display the filtered results in the standard output (or JSON format if the global flag is active).
  - For `--export-history`, read the entire log, convert it into a JSON array, and write it to `history.json`.

- **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - If the history file does not exist or is empty, initialize it appropriately and inform the user that no history is available.
  - Provide clear error messages if file operations (read/write) fail.
  - Validate that the keyword parameter for `--search-history` is non-empty and inform the user if it is missing.

## Testing & Documentation

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Add tests to verify that search functionality correctly filters history records based on the provided keyword.
  - Create tests for exporting functionality to ensure the output file `history.json` is formatted correctly and contains all historical records.
  - Ensure that appropriate error messages are returned for cases such as missing history file or invalid keyword.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI usage documentation to include descriptions and examples of the new flags:
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --search-history greet` to filter history by the keyword "greet".
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --export-history` to export the entire command history in JSON format.
  - Include inline comments in the source code to document changes and provide usage examples.

## Alignment with Repository Mission

This enhancement reinforces the repository's focus on automation and diagnostics by further enriching the command history feature. It not only supports collaborative debugging but also ensures that detailed historical data is available for analysis and continuous improvement of workflows.
