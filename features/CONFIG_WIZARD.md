# CONFIG_WIZARD

## Overview
This feature introduces an interactive configuration wizard that guides users through setting up the essential environment variables needed to run the repository. By prompting the user for values (such as API keys and other configuration parameters) and generating a default `.env` file, the wizard ensures that the repository is correctly configured from the start. This helps new contributors quickly get up and running, while also reducing configuration errors and supporting the repository's mission of fostering healthy collaboration.

## Implementation Details
- **Interactive Prompt:**
  - Use Node.js’s built-in `readline` module to create a simple command-line interface that asks for required configuration parameters (e.g., `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY`).
  - If a `.env` file already exists, prompt the user to confirm overwriting or updating the file.

- **Integration with CONFIG Module:**
  - Leverage the existing CONFIG feature which uses `dotenv` and `zod` to load and validate environment variables. The wizard will generate a valid `.env` file that adheres to the expected schema.
  - Provide default values where appropriate and include inline documentation or comments in the `.env` file to guide further customization.

- **Single File Module:**
  - Implement the CONFIG_WIZARD as a single, self-contained source file (e.g. `src/lib/configWizard.js`), which integrates with the CLI tool. Trigger the wizard via a dedicated CLI flag (e.g. `--config-wizard`).
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Include robust error handling to catch issues like invalid inputs or file write errors, and output clear messages to the user.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simulate user input to ensure that the wizard correctly prompts for values and writes a valid `.env` file.
  - Verify that the file is not overwritten without confirmation when one already exists.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test behavior in non-interactive environments by providing appropriate fallback messages or error outputs.

## Documentation
- **User Guides:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include instructions on invoking the configuration wizard (e.g. `node src/lib/main.js --config-wizard`).
  - Provide examples of the generated `.env` file and highlight the importance of the configuration options.

## Benefits
- **Ease of Setup:** New contributors are guided through configuration, reducing setup headaches and potential errors.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that environment variables required by the repository are set according to the expected schema.
- **Enhanced Onboarding:** Improves the initial user experience, aligning with the repository’s mission of healthy collaboration and swift project initialization.
