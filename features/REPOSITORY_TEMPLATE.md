# REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE Enhancement: CLI Help & Validation Removal

This update not only reinforces the CLI help functionality but also removes all mentions of NaN and input validation from the repository. The goal is to simplify the core gcd utility and related tests while keeping the CLI help feature intact.

## Overview

- **CLI Help Utility:** When the user supplies the 'help' argument at runtime, the program displays a detailed usage message that outlines available commands and links to documentation.
- **Validation Removal:** All explicit input validations (including any checks that could relate to NaN or non-positive integers) in the gcd function are removed. This means the gcd function will operate without error-checking for inputs, and associated tests will be updated accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js)

- **CLI Help:**
  - Maintain the check for the 'help' argument and display the detailed help message as before.

- **GCD Function:**
  - Remove the input validation block that checks for non-positive integers or non-integer values.
  - The updated gcd function will simply compute the greatest common divisor without performing any input type or validity checks.
  - Example updated code:
    ```javascript
    export function gcd(a, b) {
      while (b !== 0) {
        const temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
      }
      return a;
    }
    ```

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- **CLI Help Test:**
  - Continue to simulate running with the 'help' argument and verify the correct CLI help message is output.

- **GCD Tests:**
  - Retain tests that check correct gcd computation on positive integers (e.g. gcd(48, 18) returns 6, etc.).
  - **Remove** the test case that expects an error to be thrown on non-positive integers since validation checks have been removed.

### README Update (README.md)

- Update the documentation to remove any mention of validation rules or error messages related to the gcd function.
- Ensure that usage examples focus on the functionality of gcd and the CLI help feature without referencing input validation expectations.

### Dependencies (package.json)

- No changes to dependencies or scripts are required for this update.

## Testing and Validation

- **CLI Help:** Running `node src/lib/main.js help` should output the updated help message with usage instructions and documentation links.
- **GCD Function:** Verify that the gcd function computes correct results for valid inputs and that the removed validation does not cause unintended side effects in the provided test cases (i.e. tests for error conditions on invalid input are removed).

This consolidated update aligns with the repositoryâ€™s mission to provide a simple, maintainable CLI utility that acts as a JS library function while removing extraneous validation logic.
