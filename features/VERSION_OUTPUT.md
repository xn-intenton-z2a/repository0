# VERSION_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature introduces an enhanced version reporting functionality. When the `--version` flag is used, the application will output the current version as specified in the `package.json` file. The output will be available in multiple formats (plain text and JSON) to support both human readers and automated systems, aligning with the repositoryâ€™s overall focus on streamlined diagnostics and configurable behaviors.

## Implementation Details
- **Flag Detection:** Extend the CLI parsing in `src/lib/main.js` to check if `--version` is supplied.
- **Version Retrieval:** Read the version number from the `package.json` file. This can be done synchronously for a minimal implementation, ensuring it does not introduce noticeable delay.
- **Output Formatting:** Output the version information in two formats:
  - **Plain Text:** A simple text output of the version number for quick reference (e.g. `v1.4.1-13`).
  - **JSON Format:** A JSON object output for systems integration, for example: `{ "version": "v1.4.1-13" }`.
- **Modularity:** The feature should be implemented in a self-contained manner, updating only `src/lib/main.js` and its associated tests.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add or update tests in the `tests/unit` folder (e.g. in `main.test.js`) to simulate the `--version` flag and verify the correct version is output in both formats.
- **Edge Cases:** Verify that the version output works when combined with other flags that do not conflict, maintaining precedence for version output.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING:** Update the documentation to include usage examples for the `--version` flag.
- **Usage Examples:** Provide examples in the documentation on how to run the version command:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --version
  ```
- **Integration Note:** Mention the automated update flow in GitHub workflows to ensure that any version bump in `package.json` reflects across the repository.
