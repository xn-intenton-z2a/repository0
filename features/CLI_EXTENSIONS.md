# Overview
This feature extends the core CLI functionality by implementing the missing behaviors for the --version and --diagnostics flags. In addition to the current dynamic help message and JSON output for CLI commands, the CLI will now provide accurate version information and diagnostic details.

# Implementation Details
- Update the main source file (src/lib/main.js) to support new flag branches:
  - When the --version flag is provided, read the version number from package.json, obtain the current timestamp, and output a combined message (e.g., Version: x.y.z, Timestamp: current_time).
  - When the --diagnostics flag is provided, collect runtime details including Node.js version (from process.version), platform (from process.platform), and other environment configurations. Display these details in a clear, formatted manner.
- Enhance existing CLI flow so that these additional branches integrate seamlessly with the current help message and JSON output.

# Tests
- In the unit tests (tests/unit/main.test.js), add and update test cases to:
  - Validate that running with the --version flag produces output containing the correct version information and a current timestamp.
  - Ensure that using the --diagnostics flag outputs a detailed report containing Node.js and environment information.

# Documentation
- Update the README.md and docs/USAGE.md to include details on how the new flags work and examples of their output, ensuring users understand the extended functionalities.

This extension solidifies the repository's mission by enhancing the CLI as a comprehensive tool, directly improving usability and the overall reliability of the core features.
