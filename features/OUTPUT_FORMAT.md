# OUTPUT_FORMAT

## Overview
This feature introduces a flexible output formatting mechanism for the CLI application. It provides a unified way to display messages, diagnostics, and warnings either in plain text or JSON format. Additionally, it allows configurable options for metadata inclusion, warning indexing, and punctuation stripping. This enhancement aligns with the repositoryâ€™s mission of delivering actionable insights and ensuring clarity in automated CI/CD workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new flag `--output-format` that accepts values such as `json` or `text`. When set to `json`, the output will include additional metadata along with the message content.
  - Introduce a new flag `--strip-punctuation` which, when enabled, removes punctuation from the output messages.
  
- **Metadata and Warning Indexing:**
  - When in JSON mode, append metadata fields such as a timestamp and a system-generated warning index. The warning index mode will number each warning, making them easier to reference in logs and error reports.
  - Ensure that both plain text and JSON outputs are generated in a clear and consistent format.

- **Modularity:**
  - Encapsulate the output formatting logic in a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/outputFormat.js`) so that it can be easily maintained or expanded in the future.
  - Update the main CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to invoke the output formatter based on the flags provided.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Add tests in the `tests/unit` folder to verify that the output is correctly formatted for both JSON and plain text modes.
  - Include tests for the `--strip-punctuation` feature to ensure that output messages are correctly cleaned.
  - Verify that metadata (such as the timestamp and warning index) is correctly appended in JSON mode.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents with usage examples:
  ```bash
  # Using JSON output mode with metadata
  node src/lib/main.js --output-format json
  
  # Using plain text output with punctuation stripping
  node src/lib/main.js --output-format text --strip-punctuation
  ```
- Document the purpose of warning indexing and provide guidance on interpreting indexed warning messages.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Clarity:** Uniform output formatting enhances readability, making it easier to integrate CLI outputs into automated workflows and logs.
- **Actionable Insights:** The inclusion of metadata such as timestamps and warning indices helps in diagnosing issues and optimizing CI/CD processes.
- **User Customization:** By supporting both JSON and plain text formats, as well as optional punctuation stripping, users can tailor the output to suit various use cases and readability preferences.
