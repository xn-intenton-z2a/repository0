# CORE_CLI Feature Update

This update enhances the CLI functionality in the main source file by adding a new update command. In addition to the existing version, diagnostics, and help commands, the CLI will now handle an update command that simulates an update check. The command will provide users with feedback on whether an update is available.

# Implementation Details

- Update src/lib/main.js:
  - Add a branch in the command dispatcher to detect if the first argument equals "update".
  - When the update command is invoked, simulate an update check by printing a message, for example, "No update available".

- Update tests in tests/unit/main.test.js:
  - Add a new test case that invokes the update command and verifies that the output matches the expected update check message.

- Update Documentation:
  - Revise README.md and docs/USAGE.md to include instructions for using the update command. Specify the usage as "npm run check-update" or "node src/lib/main.js update", and mention that the command simulates an update check by indicating that no update is available.

- Ensure package.json mapping remains consistent with the update command using the "check-update" script.

# User Impact

Users benefit from a more robust CLI experience. The update command offers additional feedback regarding update status, aligning the CLI tool with the overall project template goals. This improvement complements the automated workflows by ensuring that user interactions through the CLI are both informative and consistent.

# Testing and Validation

- Unit tests will cover the update command along with the existing subcommands.
- The new test for the update command will verify that the CLI outputs the correct message when "update" is passed as an argument.
- Documentation updates ensure users are aware of the new command and its expected behavior.
