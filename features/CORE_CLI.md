# CORE_CLI Feature Update

This update enhances the CLI functionality by fully implementing the update command. In addition to the existing commands (version, diagnostics, help), the CLI now explicitly recognizes the update command.

# Implementation Overview

The update command will be integrated into the main CLI executor in the source file. When a user invokes the update command, the CLI will output the text No update available and exit without performing any further operations.

# Changes to Source File (src/lib/main.js)

- Add a new condition to check if the input command is update.
- If the command is update, log No update available and exit immediately.
- Maintain the existing functionality for version, diagnostics, help, and default cases.

# Updates to Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)

- Introduce a new test case that calls the main function with the update command.
- Verify that the output is exactly No update available to ensure the new branch functions correctly.

# Documentation and README Updates

- Update the README.md CLI Commands section to document the new update command. It should describe the command, its usage (such as via npm run check-update or node src/lib/main.js update), and its expected output.

# Dependencies and Scripts

- Confirm that package.json includes the script check-update mapped to node src/lib/main.js update. No additional dependency changes are necessary.

By implementing these changes, the CLI will provide clear feedback regarding updates and further reinforce the repository template's commitment to robust, automated workflows.
