# CORE_CLI Feature Update

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CLI command dispatcher in the main JavaScript source file. In addition to supporting version and diagnostics commands, the CLI now handles an update command that simulates an update check. This update ensures alignment with the functionalities present in package.json and provides users with direct feedback on whether an update is available.

## Implementation Details
- Update src/lib/main.js:
  - Add logic to detect if the first argument equals "update".
  - When the "update" command is invoked, simulate an update check. For example, you may display a message stating "No update available" or a simulated message that an update is available.
  
- Update tests in tests/unit/main.test.js:
  - Add a new test case for the "update" command to verify that the expected update check message is printed.

- Update documentation in README.md and docs/USAGE.md:
  - Document the new CLI command "update" with instructions on how to invoke it (e.g. npm run start update or npm run check-update), and describe its behavior.

- Update package.json if needed:
  - Ensure that the command mapping for "check-update" aligns with the new behavior in main.js.

## User Impact
Users will benefit from a more complete CLI experience. The update command provides clear feedback regarding update status, making the CLI a more robust tool as part of the overall project template. This update consolidates CLI features while removing redundant workflow specifications from agentic-lib integration.

## Testing and Validation
Unit tests will cover the update command along with existing subcommand tests for version and diagnostics. This update ensures that the main functionality of the CLI remains stable and that new behaviors are correctly documented and tested.
