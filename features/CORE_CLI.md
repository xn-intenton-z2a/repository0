# CORE_CLI Feature Update

This update enhances the CLI functionality by fully implementing the update command. In addition to the existing commands (version, diagnostics, help), the CLI now supports the update command. When invoked with "update", the CLI simulates an update check and prints the message "No update available".

## Implementation Details

- Update src/lib/main.js:
  - Add a new branch in the command dispatcher for the "update" command. When the "update" command is detected, print the message "No update available" and exit.

- Testing in tests/unit/main.test.js:
  - Add a new test case that calls main(["update"]) and checks that the output is exactly "No update available".

- Documentation Updates:
  - Revise docs/USAGE.md to include the update command. Describe its usage (e.g., "node src/lib/main.js update" or via npm script "npm run check-update") and the expected output.
  - Update README.md to reference the availability of the update command, ensuring users know they can check for updates even though it simulates the behavior.

- Dependency and Script Validation:
  - Confirm that package.json already includes the "check-update" script which maps to the update command.

## User Impact

Users benefit from a more complete CLI experience. By adding the update command, the CLI provides clear feedback on update status, complementing diagnostic processes and the existing workflow automation. This change reinforces the repository template's role in acting as a robust starting point for projects.
