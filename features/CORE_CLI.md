# CORE CLI Feature Update

## Overview
This update enhances the CLI functionality by fully integrating the update command alongside the existing commands: version, diagnostics, and help. The update command is designed to notify the user that no update is available, maintaining a consistent user experience with the rest of the CLI.

## Implementation Details
- In the source file (src/lib/main.js), add a new condition to check if the input command is update. When the command is update, the script will output "No update available" and exit immediately.
- Preserve the existing command behaviors and default to the help message for unrecognized commands.

## Testing
- In tests/unit/main.test.js, introduce a new test case that invokes the update command and verifies that the console output is exactly "No update available".
- This test will mirror the testing approach for the version, diagnostics, and help commands to ensure consistent behavior.

## Documentation
- Update the CLI Commands section in README.md and docs/USAGE.md to include the update command. Document its usage (e.g., via npm script check-update or node src/lib/main.js update) and the expected output.

## Dependencies and Scripts
- In package.json, ensure that the script check-update is mapped to "node src/lib/main.js update" so that users can conveniently invoke the update command.
- No additional dependencies are required.

This update meets the repository's goal of providing robust CLI functionality and aligns with the mission of delivering a reliable, automated coding system.
