# CORE_CLI Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the main CLI command by adding a core command dispatcher inside the source file. The dispatcher interprets subcommands such as version, diagnostics, and update. The repository will now present a more functional CLI utility that aligns with the mission of providing handy CLI functionalities in a Node.js environment.

## Implementation Details
- Update the main source file (src/lib/main.js) to check process arguments. When a recognized subcommand is detected, execute the corresponding functionality:
  - For the "version" command, display the current version from package.json.
  - For the "diagnostics" command, display system and repository diagnostic information.
  - For the "update" command, simulate the update check and notify the user if an update is available.

- Enhance the test file (tests/unit/main.test.js) by including tests that cover these new subcommand behaviors. Tests should verify that each valid command produces the expected output without error.

- Update the README.md to document the new CLI subcommands. The documentation must explain how to invoke the new commands (e.g., npm run start version, npm run start diagnostics, npm run start update) and describe the expected outcomes.

- Adjust the dependencies file (package.json) scripts if necessary to align with these new command functionalities. Ensure that the updated functionality is integrated within the existing workflow structure.

## User Impact
This feature directly enhances the primary CLI utility by adding core functionalities that users can reliably interact with, offering clear and immediate feedback. This implementation supports the mission by providing a tangible CLI tool that is simple yet effective within a single JavaScript source file.

## Testing and Validation
All modifications will be covered by unit tests in the tests/unit directory. The tests will ensure no regressions occur in existing functionality and that subcommands work as expected.

## Conclusion
The CORE_CLI feature builds on the existing template to offer significant value by providing a fully functional CLI command dispatcher. It aligns with the repository's mission to serve as a base for handy CLI utilities.
