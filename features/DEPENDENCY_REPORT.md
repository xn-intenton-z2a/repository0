# Dependency Report

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight dependency reporting tool for the repository. The tool scans the project's package.json to extract dependency versions, compares them against the latest available versions (using tools like npm-check-updates), and generates a report outlining outdated packages, potential security advisories, and version mismatches. This report improves project maintainability and provides actionable insights for CI/CD workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new flag `--dep-report` in the main CLI (e.g. in `src/lib/main.js` or a dedicated module).
  - When invoked, the tool loads the package.json, checks current dependency versions, and queries for updated information using the npm-check-updates library or similar techniques.

- **Report Generation:**
  - Generate a human-readable markdown or JSON report that lists outdated dependencies, current versions, and the latest available versions.
  - Provide an optional flag (e.g. `--json`) to output the report as structured JSON, useful for automated tools in CI/CD pipelines.

- **Modularity and Maintainability:**
  - The dependency report functionality is implemented in a single source file (e.g. `src/lib/depReport.js`) to ensure ease of maintenance.
  - Integrate robust error handling to address scenarios like missing or malformed package.json files.

- **Testing and Documentation:**
  - Add unit tests to simulate various scenarios including all dependencies up-to-date, outdated, or missing from the report.
  - Update documentation in the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage examples and instructions:
  ```bash
  # Generate a dependency report in human-readable format
  node src/lib/main.js --dep-report
  
  # Generate a dependency report in JSON format
  node src/lib/main.js --dep-report --json
  ```

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintenance:** Provides immediate insights about dependency status, enabling developers to keep the project up-to-date.
- **Actionable Insights for CI/CD:** Facilitates automated checks within CI pipelines to flag outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
- **Simplicity and Focus:** Developed as a self-contained tool, it adds value without over-complicating the existing codebase.
