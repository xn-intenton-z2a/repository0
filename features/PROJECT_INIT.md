# PROJECT_INIT

## Overview
This feature introduces a simple project initialization capability directly from the CLI. It allows users to quickly bootstrap a new project using the repository template structure from repository0. By invoking the initialization command, the CLI will set up a basic project scaffold, including configuration files, template code, and necessary directories. This helps new users start their projects faster and ensures that they adhere to the repository's standards and workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Add a new CLI flag (e.g., `--init`) in the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to trigger project initialization.
  - When the flag is detected, delegate the initialization process to a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/projectInit.js`).

- **Initialization Process:**
  - The `projectInit.js` module will contain logic to copy or generate essential template files (e.g., README.md, .env, CONTRIBUTING.md, and a basic directory structure) into a target directory specified by the user.
  - If no target directory is provided, default to the current working directory, while ensuring existing files aren't overwritten without confirmation.
  - Include error handling to deal with common file system issues (e.g., permission errors, target directory not writable).

- **Modularity and Simplicity:**
  - The entire functionality is implemented as a single source file for ease of maintenance.
  - Use Node.js built-in modules such as `fs` and `path` for file operations, ensuring compatibility with the repository's configuration and CI/CD workflows.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/projectInit.test.js`) to simulate the command-line invocation with the `--init` flag.
  - Verify that the correct files and directories are created in a temporary directory and that errors are handled gracefully.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include instructions on how to use the `--init` flag for project initialization.
- Provide examples, such as:
  ```bash
  # Initialize a new project in the current directory
  node src/lib/main.js --init
  
  # Initialize a new project in a specified directory
  node src/lib/main.js --init ./my-new-project
  ```

## Benefits
- **Rapid Bootstrapping:** Provides an easy and consistent way for users to start a new project using the repository0 template.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that all new projects begin with the same structure and configuration, promoting best practices from the start.
- **Ease of Use:** Reduces manual setup steps, accelerating development and lowering the barrier for contributions.
