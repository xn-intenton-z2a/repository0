# CONFIG

## Overview
This feature introduces a centralized configuration management system for repository0. It is designed to load, validate, and manage environment variables and other configuration settings using a simple, consistent API. By leveraging tools such as dotenv and zod, the CONFIG module ensures that all required settings are present and valid, thus supporting robust CI/CD workflows and healthy collaboration.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Loading:**
  - Use the dotenv library to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring that configuration values are initialized before other modules are executed.
  - Provide support for default values, allowing the system to fall back on sensible defaults if certain variables are not defined.

- **Validation:**
  - Integrate zod for schema validation to verify that the loaded configuration adheres to expected types and constraints.
  - If configuration validation fails, the module should exit gracefully with a clear error message and appropriate exit code (as defined in the EXIT_CODES feature).

- **API Design:**
  - Expose a simple, unified API that lets other parts of the application retrieve configuration values.
  - Enable runtime reloading or refreshing of configuration if needed, supporting dynamic changes without restarting the application where possible.

- **Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to initialize the CONFIG module early in the startup process.
  - Ensure that other features such as HTTP_API, LOGGING, and NUMERIC_SAFE can access configuration data using the provided API.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/config.test.js`) to simulate loading of environment variables, validate schema correctness, and verify that default values are applied appropriately.
  - Test edge cases where the `.env` file is missing or contains invalid values.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING:**
  - Update documentation to include instructions on how to use and extend the configuration management module.
  - Provide usage examples and guidelines for setting up the `.env` file with required values.
  - Document how the CONFIG module interacts with other features and its role in supporting the repositoryâ€™s mission.
