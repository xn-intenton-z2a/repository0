# HISTORY_LOG with SEARCH

## Overview
This update enhances the existing HISTORY_LOG feature by adding robust search and filtering capabilities to the command history audit. In addition to recording every CLI command execution with its inputs, outputs, timestamp, and duration, users can now query the history for specific commands, keywords, or date ranges. This improvement further supports traceability and debugging while reinforcing our commitment to healthy collaboration and practical automation.

## CLI Integration
- **New Sub-Commands:**
  - `--history search <query>`: Filters the audit log entries by matching the provided query string in command names, inputs, or error messages.
  - `--history filter --start <date> --end <date>`: Returns history entries logged within a specific ISO date range.
- **Output Modes:**
  - Supports plain text summary as well as JSON output (using the existing `--json` and `--json-pretty` flags) for machine-friendly querying.
- **User Experience:**
  - The enhanced history command provides pagination and summary statistics (total entries found) when a filter or search is applied.

## Implementation Details
- **Audit Log Extension:**
  - The persistent JSON file (e.g., `.repository_history.json`) now includes all previous fields and is queried based on user input.
  - A lightweight in-memory search index is built at startup to optimize query performance over the (typically small) log file.
- **Query Parsing & Filtering:**
  - The CLI parses search queries or filter parameters and returns matching log entries. Date range filtering uses ISO formatted timestamps.
  - In case of an invalid query or date format, a clear error message is returned along with usage guidance.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error validation ensures that queries that yield no results inform the user rather than failing silently.
  - File I/O errors during history retrieval are caught and reported, similar to existing logging error handling.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - New tests are added to simulate various search queries and date range filters. Tests will cover expected matches as well as no-result scenarios.
  - Existing tests for log appending and retrieval remain unchanged.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI help documentation to include examples:
    - `node src/lib/main.js --history search sum`
    - `node src/lib/main.js --history filter --start 2023-10-01T00:00:00Z --end 2023-10-31T23:59:59Z`
  - Inline comments and markdown files are updated to reflect these enhancements.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By integrating search and filtering directly into the HISTORY_LOG feature, this update empowers users to quickly locate past command executions and debug issues more efficiently. It solidifies the tool's role in promoting transparency, traceability, and actionable insights within a single, self-contained CLI repository.
