# HISTORY_LOG

## Overview
This feature adds a command history logging utility to the CLI tool. Every command execution, including its input parameters, output (or error), timestamp, and execution duration, is recorded in a persistent local JSON file (e.g., `.repository_history.json`). In addition, a new CLI flag `--history` is introduced to view the audit log directly from the command line. This improves traceability, debugging, and accountability within the tool, in line with the repositoryâ€™s mission for healthy collaboration and streamlined automation.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Add a new flag `--history` to display the audit log.
  - When invoked without additional parameters, it displays a summary of past CLI commands and their execution times.
  - Supports optional flags like `--json` or `--json-pretty` for structured output.
- **Audit Logging:** Every command (whether successful or an error) is logged with metadata including:
  - Timestamp in ISO 8601 format
  - Command name and cleansed input parameters
  - Execution duration in milliseconds
  - Result or error message

## Implementation Details
- **Logging Mechanism:** Implement a lightweight logging module within the repository that appends a JSON entry for each command execution to a file named `.repository_history.json`.
  - Use synchronous file operations from Node's fs module to ensure atomic writes and immediate persistence.
  - Each log entry is an object containing the fields: `timestamp`, `command`, `inputEcho`, `executionDuration`, and `result` (or `error`).
- **History Retrieval:** The `--history` command reads the JSON log file and outputs its contents:
  - In default mode, displays a human-readable summary (e.g., one entry per line).
  - In JSON mode, prints the complete JSON object for programmatic use.
- **Performance Considerations:** Implement file rotation or archiving if the log file exceeds a preset size (optional enhancement for future iterations).

## Error Handling & Documentation
- Validate file I/O operations to handle potential read/write errors, and provide fallback messages if the log file is inaccessible.
- Include unit tests to simulate and verify that logs are correctly appended and retrieved for each CLI command execution.
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include instructions on how to use the `--history` command and interpret the audit log output.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By adding a dedicated command history logger, the tool enhances diagnostics and accountability while promoting healthy collaboration. The HISTORY_LOG feature provides end-users and contributors with immediate access to past execution details, reinforcing transparency and aiding troubleshooting, which is in full accordance with the repository's mission of providing modular and self-contained CLI utilities.
