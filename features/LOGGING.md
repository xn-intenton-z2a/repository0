# Overview
This feature merges file-based logging, log rotation, and configurable log levels into a single cohesive logging module. It provides a unified interface for managing logs that includes writing logs to files, automatically rotating them based on size, and filtering log outputs by severity. This consolidated approach simplifies configuration and ensures consistency in how logs are handled across the application.

# Implementation Details
- **File Logging:**
  - Introduce a CLI flag `--log-file <filename>` that activates logging to the specified file. Log entries should include timestamps and be formatted in a consistent, human-readable format.
  - Implement a dedicated logging module (e.g. `src/lib/logging.js`) that handles writing messages to file as well as console output.

- **Log Rotation:**
  - Integrate log rotation capabilities into the logging module. When the file reaches a predefined size threshold (configurable via an environment variable or a default value), the module should rename the current log file with a timestamp or incremental index and start a new log file.
  - Support activation via a CLI flag such as `--enable-log-rotation` or through configuration in the environment.

- **Configurable Log Levels:**
  - Support a `--log-level <level>` flag where `<level>` can be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR. The logging module should only output messages at or above the configured level.
  - Ensure that the log level filtering applies uniformly to both console and file outputs.

- **Optional Log Summary (Enhancement):**
  - Optionally, add functionality to generate a summary of log events, e.g. aggregating counts of errors, warnings, and info messages. This can be triggered via a dedicated CLI flag if needed to assist with diagnostics in CI/CD workflows.

# Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Develop tests to ensure that log entries are correctly written to files, that rotation is triggered once the file size threshold is crossed, and that log level filtering works as expected.
- **Edge Cases:** Test behavior for unwritable file paths, missing directories, and invalid log level inputs. Ensure fallback mechanisms allow the application to continue logging to the console if file logging fails.

# Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include instructions for using the unified logging system, examples for CLI flags (`--log-file`, `--enable-log-rotation`, `--log-level`), and troubleshooting tips.
- Ensure integration with existing diagnostics and observability features by referencing the new logging functionality.

This consolidated logging feature enhances the repository's mission by providing a robust, easy-to-maintain mechanism for capturing and managing logs, ultimately supporting dependable and clear CI/CD workflows.
