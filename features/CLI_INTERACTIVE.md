# CLI_INTERACTIVE

## Overview
This feature consolidates interactive CLI capabilities, robust command routing, and auto-completion support into a single module. It integrates functionalities from previous interactive tools along with shell completion, allowing users to benefit from a unified, user-friendly interface for CLI operations.

## Command Routing and Interactive Session
- **Centralized Command Management:** Integrates CLI flag parsing, alias substitution, error handling, and REPL mode using Node.js's readline module.
- **Unified Trace Logging and History:** Logs executed commands with timestamps and provides consistent error and output formatting.
- **Dynamic Startup Banner:** Displays a stylized banner on interactive startup, including repository name, current version (from package.json), and mission tagline. Optionally disabled with a `--no-banner` flag.

## Auto Completion Integration
- **Shell Completion Scripts:** Merges the shell completion functionality to enable generating auto-completion scripts for popular shells (bash, zsh, fish) via a dedicated CLI flag (e.g. `--completion <shell>`).
- **Self-contained Implementation:** Uses built-in Node.js APIs to generate the correct script syntax for the specified shell, ensuring that the output scripts are easily sourced or installed by users.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integrates with the existing interactive mode so that both command routing and auto-completion enhancements coexist without interfering with other functionalities.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a unified interactive CLI interface with real-time command assistance and auto-completion.
- **Maintainability:** Consolidates overlapping functionalities into one well-structured module, reducing redundancy and easing future enhancements.
- **Improved Productivity:** Streamlines CLI operations by offering dynamic command discovery and execution, supporting both manual and automated workflows.
