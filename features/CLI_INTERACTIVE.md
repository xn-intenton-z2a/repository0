# CLI_INTERACTIVE

## Overview
This feature consolidates interactive CLI capabilities and robust command routing into a single module. By merging functionalities from the existing COMMAND_UTILS and INTERACTIVE_TOOLS, the new CLI_INTERACTIVE feature streamlines alias management, command routing, REPL mode, unified trace logging, and startup banner display into one cohesive, user-friendly interface. This consolidation reduces redundancy and maintains the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and seamless CI/CD workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized Command Routing and Interactive Session:**
  - Integrate CLI flag parsing, alias substitution, and error handling into one module.
  - Provide a REPL mode using Node.js’s built-in `readline` module for continuous command evaluation.
  - Maintain command history tracking by logging executed commands with timestamps.

- **Unified Trace and Output Formatting:**
  - When the `--trace` flag is active, log detailed execution events with enhanced formatting for improved debugging.
  - Process all CLI messages and errors through a unified formatter to ensure consistency across modes.

- **Dynamic Startup Banner:**
  - Display a stylized banner on startup in interactive mode, featuring repository name, current version (from package.json), and an inspirational mission tagline.
  - Allow users to disable the banner via a `--no-banner` flag.

- **Modular Design:**
  - Encapsulate all interactive and routing logic in a single source file to improve maintainability and reduce duplication.
  - Ensure backward compatibility so that non-interactive commands remain unaffected.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop tests to simulate various CLI inputs including alias resolution, REPL command execution, and banner display behavior.
  - Verify that enabling and disabling the banner, as well as daily command execution logging and unified error messages, function as expected.

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Validate seamless integration with other CLI operations and ensure that merging functionalities do not break existing feature behavior.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a single, consolidated interface for both command routing and interactive sessions, making it easier for users to navigate CLI operations.
- **Maintainability:** Reduces complexity by consolidating overlapping functionalities, allowing for easier future enhancements and debugging.
- **Consistency and Efficiency:** Offers unified trace logging and output formatting, improving diagnostics and support for both manual use and automated CI/CD workflows.
