# PERFORMANCE_MONITOR

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight performance monitoring module for the CLI application. It captures execution times for commands and aggregates performance data across runs, providing users with insights into potential bottlenecks. This module aims to promote responsiveness and reliability, aligning with the repository’s mission to support healthy collaboration and robust CI/CD workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **Command Timing:**
  - Wrap the main execution flow in timing logic using Node.js’s high-resolution timers (e.g. process.hrtime).
  - Calculate the duration for each command executed by the CLI and log the execution time.

- **Data Aggregation:**
  - Store individual command durations along with timestamps in a local JSON file (e.g. `perfStats.json`) at the repository root.
  - Provide an option to aggregate and average performance metrics over multiple runs.

- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new flag (e.g. `--perf-stats`) to display performance statistics in human-readable text or JSON format.
  - Optionally support a flag to reset the performance data (e.g. `--reset-perf`), allowing users to clear aggregated statistics.

- **Modularity:**
  - Encapsulate the performance monitoring logic in a dedicated source file (e.g. `src/lib/performanceMonitor.js`) to ensure ease of maintenance.
  - Ensure that the monitoring does not interfere with the normal operation of other CLI functions.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop tests to verify that the timing mechanism correctly measures the duration of simulated commands.
  - Test the aggregation logic to confirm that statistics (such as averages and totals) are computed accurately.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that errors in the performance monitoring (such as file access issues) do not impact the primary CLI operations, with appropriate fallbacks.

## Benefits
- **Actionable Insights:** By tracking execution times, users gain clear visibility into the performance of various commands.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness:** Identifying slow operations can drive targeted optimizations for a more responsive CLI experience.
- **Data-Driven Improvements:** Aggregated performance statistics provide a basis for iterative improvements in the repository and CI/CD workflows.
