# Dockerizer

## Overview
The Dockerizer feature adds containerization support to the repository by providing a CLI command to automatically generate a Dockerfile. This module enables developers to quickly scaffold a Docker configuration based on project metadata and common Node.js best practices.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--dockerize`) in the main entry file (`src/lib/main.js`).
  - When invoked, the feature will check for the presence of a Dockerfile in the repository root.
  - If no Dockerfile exists, the module generates one automatically.

- **Dockerfile Generation:**
  - Read key fields from `package.json` (such as the Node.js version if specified, project name, and main script) to inform the Dockerfile creation.
  - Generate a Dockerfile with standard instructions:
    - Base image (e.g. `FROM node:20`)
    - Setting up the working directory (e.g. `WORKDIR /app`)
    - Copying package files and source code
    - Installing dependencies
    - Exposing a default port (optional, if applicable)
    - Setting the default command to run the application

- **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
  - If a Dockerfile already exists, the CLI will notify the user and abort generation to prevent overwriting custom configurations.
  - Provide informative logging messages to inform the user of success or illustrate any potential issues during file generation.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests that simulate scenarios where a Dockerfile is missing and ensure the file is generated with the expected content.
  - Test the behavior when an existing Dockerfile is detected to ensure that no overwriting occurs.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Verify that the CLI flag integrates seamlessly with other commands and that output messages are clear and actionable.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage examples:
  ```bash
  # Generate a Dockerfile in the repository root if it does not exist
  node src/lib/main.js --dockerize
  ```
- Include details on the generated Dockerfile structure and how developers can customize it further if needed.

## Benefits
- **Ease of Containerization:** Quickly scaffold a Dockerfile, reducing the barrier to containerizing the application.
- **Consistency:** Provides a standardized Dockerfile that aligns with Node.js best practices, ensuring containerized deployments are reliable.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Notifies users if a Dockerfile already exists to avoid conflicts, streamlining development workflows.
