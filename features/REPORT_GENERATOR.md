# REPORT_GENERATOR

## Overview
This feature introduces a comprehensive report generator that aggregates critical repository metrics and diagnostics into a unified report. The report includes data from logs, test coverage, dependency status, version history, and usage analytics. It is designed to support CI/CD workflows and provide actionable insights for both developers and automated monitoring systems.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Aggregation:**
  - Collect log summaries from the unified logging module and include log rotation and cleanup information.
  - Retrieve diagnostic data and performance metrics from the REPO_INFO and HTTP_API (/profile) endpoints.
  - Aggregate dependency and version information from the RELEASE_MANAGER and TEMPLATE_MANAGER modules.
  - Include usage analytics from the CLI_MANAGER to highlight command frequency and recent interactions.
- **Output Options:**
  - The report can be generated in JSON format for automated processing as well as in an HTML format for human reading.
  - Add a new CLI flag (e.g. `--generate-report`) to trigger the report generation from the main entry point.
  - Support an optional `--html` flag to output the report as a styled HTML document.
- **Modular Design:**
  - Implement all functionalities in a single module (e.g. `src/lib/reportGenerator.js`) to ensure ease of maintenance and integration.
  - Provide configurable options for selecting data sources and customizing report details.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write tests to simulate various repository states and verify that each section (logs, diagnostics, dependency info, etc.) is correctly incorporated into the final report.
  - Validate both JSON and HTML outputs to ensure correct structure and content.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test scenarios with missing or incomplete data from any module, ensuring the report generates gracefully with informative placeholders.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with examples on how to invoke the report generator:
  ```bash
  # Generate a comprehensive report in JSON format
  node src/lib/main.js --generate-report

  # Generate the report in HTML format
  node src/lib/main.js --generate-report --html
  ```
- Include a section detailing the configurable options and data aggregation process.

## Benefits
- **Unified Insights:** Combines diagnostics, logs, and dependency information into a single, actionable report.
- **Enhanced CI/CD Integration:** Facilitates automated monitoring and reporting, aiding in proactive issue detection and system tuning.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Provides contributors with a clear overview of repository health and performance trends, promoting healthy collaboration.
