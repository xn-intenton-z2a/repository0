# PLUGIN SYSTEM

## Overview
This feature introduces a dynamic plugin system to extend the CLI tool’s functionality. Users can add their custom commands by placing simple JavaScript modules in a designated plugins directory. The system will automatically load these plugins at runtime, enabling an extensible architecture without modifying the core repository code.

## CLI Integration
- **Plugin Directory:** The CLI will check for a `plugins/` directory at startup. If present, it will dynamically import all `.js` files found there.
- **Command Mapping:** Each plugin must export a command identifier (e.g. `--custom`) and a handler function. The system integrates these commands into the existing command mapping so that users can invoke them just like built-in commands.
- **Flag or Auto-load:** Plugins are auto-loaded at startup. Optionally, a global flag (e.g. `--list-plugins`) can be added to display all loaded plugins and their descriptions.

## Implementation Details
- **Dynamic Import:** Use Node.js’s dynamic `import()` to load each JavaScript file from the `plugins/` directory. Validate that the module exports the required interface (a command name and a handler function).
- **Error Handling:** If a plugin fails to load or does not conform to the expected interface, the CLI logs a warning but continues to load other plugins without crashing.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Update the README with instructions for creating and adding new plugins. Write unit tests to simulate plugin loading from a temporary directory and ensure that custom commands execute as expected.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The PLUGIN SYSTEM feature supports healthy collaboration by allowing community contributions without changing the core code. It reinforces the modular design of the CLI tool, enabling easy customization and extension to suit diverse automation workflows.
