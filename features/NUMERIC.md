# NUMERIC

## Overview
This feature provides a unified numerical computation module that consolidates arithmetic, statistical, combinatorial, and complex number operations. It now integrates a comprehensive NaN diagnostics submodule which not only reports token parsing errors but also provides detailed insights such as the character range (trimStart and trimEnd) of modifications during token normalization. Additional enhancements include configurable punctuation stripping, a caching mechanism for performance optimization, and the new inline flag (--allow-nan-inline) for temporary toggling of NaN acceptance.

## CLI Integration
- **Primary Commands:** Operations like `--sum`, `--subtract`, `--multiply`, `--divide`, and statistical commands such as `--median`, `--mode`, `--stddev`, and `--percentile` are supported as before.
- **Diagnostic Sub-Command:** The integrated `--diagnose-nan` command now outputs a detailed report on token processing. It captures the original token, its trimmed version, the exact indices (trimStart and trimEnd) that indicate which characters were preserved after trimming, and a suggestion message when tokens resembling "NaN" are rejected. This operation is compatible with both plain text and JSON output modes.
- **Inline Flag:** The new `--allow-nan-inline` flag allows the current command invocation to temporarily accept tokens resembling "NaN" without modifying the global configuration, ensuring that changes are transient and isolated.

## Implementation Details
- **Token Parsing:** Prior to numeric conversion, input tokens are trimmed for whitespace and, depending on the `TOKEN_PUNCTUATION_CONFIG` environment variable, processed to remove unwanted punctuation. A caching mechanism is employed to store previously processed tokens, reducing overhead in high-volume scenarios.
- **NaN Handling:** The parser rigorously checks for any token representing "NaN" in any capitalization or with surrounding punctuation. By default, such tokens are rejected and paired with detailed warnings indicating their position (using dynamic warning indexes if enabled). Users can alter this behavior globally with the `ALLOW_NAN` environment variable or on a per-command basis via the new inline flag.
- **Diagnostics Integration:** The `--diagnose-nan` command leverages enhanced parsing logic to output not only which tokens were accepted or rejected but also the specific character range that was preserved during trimming. This improved transparency aids in debugging and educating users on the token normalization process.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive tests validate both numerical operations and diagnostic outputs. Test cases cover common edge cases, such as various punctuation, internal whitespace errors, and the transient behavior of the `--allow-nan-inline` flag.
- **Documentation:** The README, CLI usage guides, and inline code comments have been updated to reflect these enhancements. Detailed examples illustrate how users can invoke commands in standard, JSON, and diagnostic modes.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By integrating advanced diagnostics, performance optimizations through caching, and flexible configuration for handling NaN tokens, the NUMERIC feature aligns with the repositoryâ€™s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. It empowers both casual users and power users with precise control over numerical computations in a self-contained, maintainable CLI utility.
