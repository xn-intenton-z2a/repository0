# CONFIG_LOADER

## Overview
This feature introduces a configuration loader that reads environment variables from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package. The loader ensures that necessary configuration values (such as API keys and other runtime settings) are available to the application right from startup. This aligns with the repositoryâ€™s mission of enabling automated and reproducible workflows by centralizing environment configuration.

## Implementation Details
- **Module Creation:** Implement the configuration loader as a self-contained module (e.g. `src/lib/configLoader.js`).
- **Environment Loading:** On application startup, before processing any CLI arguments in `src/lib/main.js`, load the environment variables using `dotenv.config()`. 
- **Validation:** Optionally integrate with a schema validator (e.g. using `zod`) to verify that required variables exist and meet expected formats.
- **Usage:** Expose a function to retrieve configuration values across different parts of the repository. This function can be used by diagnostics, version reporting, or any feature that requires environment-specific settings.
- **Integration:** Update `src/lib/main.js` to import and invoke the configuration loader during initialization. Ensure that any missing or misconfigured variables trigger a helpful error message or default value.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests in `tests/unit/configLoader.test.js` to verify that the loader correctly reads, validates, and exports configuration values from a sample `.env` file.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure the tests cover scenarios where the `.env` file is missing, contains invalid values, or incomplete configuration, providing useful error feedback.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include a section on environment configuration. 
- Document the expected environment variables, default behaviors, and instructions for setting up a `.env` file for local development and CI/CD workflows.
- Reference the mission statement in MISSION.md to emphasize how centralizing configuration supports reliable, automated workflows.
