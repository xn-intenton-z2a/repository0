# SYSTEM_UTILS

## Overview
This feature consolidates persistent configuration management and file logging into a single module. Users can view and modify CLI settings via a persistent JSON configuration file while simultaneously enabling an audit trail of command outputs to a local log file. By merging the functionality of the former CONFIG and FILE_LOG features, the repository is streamlined and easier to maintain, reinforcing its mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation.

## CLI Integration
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Introduce the `--config` flag with subcommands:
    - `get [key]`: Display a specific configuration value or all settings if no key is provided.
    - `set <key> <value>`: Update and persist configuration settings in the JSON file (e.g., `config.json`).
    - `reset`: Reinitialize settings to their default values.
- **Persistent Logging:**
  - Introduce a global flag `--log-file <filename>`. When provided, every command’s output (success or error) along with metadata is appended to the specified file in JSON format (one entry per line).
  - Both configuration details (like TOOL_VERSION, INVALID_TOKENS, DYNAMIC_WARNING_INDEX) and command audit trails are integrated to provide consistency across the system.

## Implementation Details
- **Configuration File Management:**
  - On first run, if `config.json` does not exist, it is created with default settings.
  - Read/write operations are performed synchronously with proper error checks. Updates to configuration are reflected in runtime behavior (e.g., numeric parsing or warning indices).
- **File Logging Mechanism:**
  - Leveraging Node’s `fs` module, after each CLI command execution the output (including command name, result or error, warnings, timestamp, version, execution duration, and input echo) is logged to the specified file.
  - Log entries are maintained in a structured JSON format, facilitating later analysis and debugging.
- **Integration:**
  - Both configuration access and file logging share similar metadata, ensuring consistent output whether viewed on the console or read from persisted logs.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Invalid keys or incorrect file operations trigger clear error messages without disrupting command execution.
- If the log file cannot be written to (e.g., due to permission issues), the CLI notifies the user but continues to operate normally.
- Input validations for configuration commands remain as defined previously, including proper handling of environment variables and dynamic warning indices.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Tests will simulate configuration gets/sets/resets and file logging operations to verify that changes are correctly persisted and logged entries are correctly formatted.
- **Documentation:** README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples:
  - Configuration: `node src/lib/main.js --config get`, `--config set KEY VALUE`, `--config reset`
  - Logging: `node src/lib/main.js --log-file history.log --sum 3 4 5`
  - Inline comments in the source clarify the merged logic and error handling for both aspects.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging persistent configuration and file logging into a unified SYSTEM_UTILS feature, this update reinforces the repository’s commitment to modular, self-contained CLI utilities. It enhances traceability, transparency, and configurability—key to fostering healthy collaboration and efficient automated workflows.
