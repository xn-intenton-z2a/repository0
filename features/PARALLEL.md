# OVERVIEW

The PARALLEL feature introduces the ability for users to run multiple CLI commands concurrently within repository0. Unlike the SCHEDULER which focuses on time-delayed execution, PARALLEL allows simultaneous invocation of distinct commands, aggregating their outputs for efficient batch processing. This feature supports both plain text and JSON output modes with complete metadata, keeping inline with the repository’s mission of streamlined automation and healthy collaboration.

# CLI INTEGRATION

- **Command Flag:** `--parallel` is used to invoke the parallel execution module.
- **Usage Examples:**
  - Basic: `node src/lib/main.js --parallel "--sum 3 4" "--multiply 2 5"`
  - In JSON Mode: `node src/lib/main.js --json --parallel "--sum 10 20" "--sqrt 16"`
- **Input Format:** Accepts one or more complete command strings as separate arguments. Each command string should be a valid CLI command (excluding global flags like `--json` which are passed to PARALLEL automatically).

# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

- **Parsing & Dispatching:**
  - The module parses its arguments, each representing a self-contained CLI command with its own parameters.
  - It then invokes the corresponding command functions concurrently using asynchronous execution (e.g., leveraging `Promise.all`).

- **Aggregation of Results:**
  - Once all commands complete execution, their individual outputs are collated into an array.
  - In JSON mode, the result includes an array with each element containing the command name, its result or error, warnings, and metadata (timestamp, version, execution duration, input echo).

- **Error Handling:**
  - If one or more commands fail, the PARALLEL module captures their error messages without halting the execution of the remaining commands.
  - The aggregated output clearly indicates which commands failed and provides their corresponding error details.

# TESTING & DOCUMENTATION

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Tests will cover scenarios with all valid commands, mixed valid and invalid commands, and verifying that concurrent execution returns outputs in a predictable format.
  - Edge cases including empty command strings or malformed inputs should be handled gracefully.

- **Documentation:**
  - README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples of parallel command execution.
  - Inline code comments in the PARALLEL feature module will explain the asynchronous execution flow and aggregation logic.

# ALIGNMENT WITH REPOSITORY MISSION

By enabling concurrent execution of multiple commands, the PARALLEL feature enhances productivity and automation capabilities. It empowers users to run batch jobs efficiently, aligning with repository0’s mission to promote healthy collaboration through modular, self-contained CLI utilities.
