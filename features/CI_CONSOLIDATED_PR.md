# CI_CONSOLIDATED_PR

## Overview
Integrate the existing consolidated PR opener CLI command into the repositoryâ€™s CI workflows. This enables automated creation of a single pull request that merges both the HTTP server feature (issue #2188) and the Diagnostics Mode feature (issue #2193).

## Behavior
- Add a new CI job named `open_consolidated_pr` in the `.github/workflows/pr_opener.yml` file.
- The job runs after build and test jobs complete, on manual trigger or schedule.
- Steps:
  1. Checkout the repository.
  2. Set up Node.js (version 20).
  3. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
  4. Run `npm run open-prs-consolidated` to invoke the CLI and open a consolidated PR.
- The CLI will:
  - Authenticate with GitHub CLI (`gh auth status`).
  - Create branch `open-prs-http-diagnostics`.
  - Run `gh pr create --title "Merge HTTP server and diagnostics features" --body "- resolves #2188\n- resolves #2193"`.
  - Log `Opened consolidated PR for HTTP server and diagnostics` on success.
  - Exit with code 0 or print an error and exit with code 1 on failure.
