# NAN_HANDLER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces robust handling for NaN (Not a Number) values throughout the CLI operations of the repository. It centralizes environment configuration to ensure consistent behavior while managing NaN values. Users can dynamically enable, configure, and diagnose NaN handling using dedicated command-line flags.

## Implementation
- **CLI Flags:**
  - `--toggle-allow-nan`: Enables or disables runtime configuration of NaN handling.
  - `--allow-nan-inline`: Allows per-command inline acceptance of NaN values.
  - `--diagnose-nan`: Provides detailed diagnostic output related to NaN occurrences and configurations.
  - `--ignore-invalid`: Bypasses invalid tokens during command parsing.
- **Centralized Configuration:**
  - Integrate a central module to manage and expose the NaN configuration to relevant parts of the application.
  - Ensure that NaN handling logic is accessible across the repository, especially within the main CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`).
- **Integration with Existing Structure:**
  - Update the main execution logic to parse and apply these flags appropriately.
  - Ensure that existing workflows can benefit from enhanced NaN handling without disruption.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop unit tests to verify that each CLI flag triggers the appropriate behavior.
  - Simulate environments with various NaN settings to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Validate that the CLI output (including diagnostic messages) is reliable and informative when NaN flags are used.

## Documentation
- Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include usage examples for the new NaN handling flags.
- Provide inline code documentation and usage scenarios, including command-line examples demonstrating enabling/disabling NaN handling and diagnosing issues.

This feature aligns with the mission of repository0 by enhancing the templateâ€™s utility as a showcase for robust, configurable CLI behavior and automated workflows.
