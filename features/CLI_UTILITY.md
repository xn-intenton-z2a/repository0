# Overview
This feature consolidates the command-line interface functionalities into a single unified implementation. It merges the help message, version display, and diagnostics reporting into one integrated flow. The update refines the CLI so that when it is executed with no arguments or with the --help flag, a comprehensive help message is shown. In addition, the --version and --diagnostics flags produce detailed outputs including the application version, timestamp, and runtime environment details. This unified approach reduces redundancy and improves usability and maintainability in line with the repository's mission.

# Implementation
- Update the main source file (src/lib/main.js) so that the main function handles all command line flags in one integrated flow.
  - When run with no arguments or with --help, the function will print a dynamic help message outlining all available CLI commands.
  - When --version is provided, the function will read the version field from package.json and output it along with the current timestamp.
  - When --diagnostics is provided, the function will output detailed diagnostic information including the Node.js version and platform details.
- Retain all existing CLI commands (such as --agentic, --dry-run, --verbose, etc.) ensuring backward compatibility.

# Tests
- In tests/unit/main.test.js, update and add test cases to:
  - Verify that the unified CLI function prints the complete help message when no arguments or --help is passed.
  - Confirm that passing --version outputs the correct version number from package.json along with a valid timestamp.
  - Ensure that passing --diagnostics results in diagnostic information that includes environment details like the Node.js version and platform.

# Documentation
- Update the README.md and docs/USAGE.md to reflect that the CLI now provides a unified interface for help, version, and diagnostics.
- Clearly document the expected behavior for each CLI flag and provide instructions for local testing and CI/CD usage.

# Impact
- This consolidation reduces code duplication by merging two existing features (HELP_MESSAGE and VERSION_DIAGNOSTICS) into one.
- Users can now rely on a single, streamlined CLI behavior which is easier to maintain and extend in future updates.
- Automated workflows and tests will benefit from the simplified command processing logic, thereby ensuring a smoother integration and more reliable operations.
