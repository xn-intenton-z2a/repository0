# ARG_PARSER Feature

This feature enhances the CLI utility in the repository by introducing a basic command parser in the source file. The parser inspects the command-line arguments and dispatches to specific functions based on recognized commands. In case of unrecognized commands, a simple help message is shown.

## Changes in src/lib/main.js

- Update the main method to implement a dispatch mechanism. For example, commands such as `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` will trigger dedicated functions.
- If no arguments or an unknown command is provided, the program will display a usage message that details the available commands.

## Changes in tests/unit/main.test.js

- Extend tests to ensure that the command dispatcher routes commands correctly.
- Add tests for each recognized command to verify that the correct output or log is generated, ensuring that the application does not crash when an invalid command is passed.

## Changes in README.md

- Update the documentation to include usage examples for the new commands. This includes instructions on how to use the CLI with commands (e.g., `npm run start diagnostics`).

## Changes in package.json (if applicable)

- Verify that the scripts remain consistent with the new functionality, e.g., ensuring that commands such as `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` trigger the updated CLI logic.

This feature supports the repository's mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js, making the tool more robust and user-friendly while maintaining integration with existing workflows.
