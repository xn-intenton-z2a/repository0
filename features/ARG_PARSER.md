# ARG_PARSER Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement refines the main function in src/lib/main.js to transform the trivial logging of arguments into a full-fledged command dispatcher. The updated CLI will recognize and process the following commands: diagnostics, version, and update.

## Implementation Details
- Modify main to inspect the first command-line argument. If it is 'version', read the version from package.json (or use a hard-coded version) and print it. If it is 'diagnostics', log key environment information and runtime diagnostics. If it is 'update', log a message indicating that an update check is in progress. For any other argument or when no argument is provided, display a help/usage message listing the supported commands.
- Update tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to simulate each of the commands (diagnostics, version, update) and validate that the output message conforms to expectations.
- Update the README.md CLI Usage section to document the new commands, along with examples of how to invoke them via the npm scripts (diagnostics, version, check-update).
- Adjust package.json if needed to confirm that the necessary npm scripts are configured for these commands.

## Benefits and Alignment
- Provides clear command dispatch and feedback to users, adhering to the repository mission of supplying useful CLI utilities in Node.js.
- Ensures maintainability by modularizing command-specific logic that can be easily extended in the future.
- Enhances test coverage and documentation, ensuring the featureâ€™s usability and reliability in an automated workflow system.
