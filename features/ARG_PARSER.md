# ARG_PARSER

## Overview
The ARG_PARSER feature introduces a robust and centralized command-line argument parser for the repository. Its purpose is to replace the rudimentary logging of CLI arguments in the main module with a structured and extensible parsing mechanism. This parser will validate, interpret, and route command-line flags and arguments to the appropriate modules, ensuring clear and actionable error messages. The feature is designed to support the repository's mission of promoting robust CI/CD workflows and healthy collaboration by providing consistent and meaningful CLI interactions.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized Parsing:**
  - Develop a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/argParser.js`) that handles all CLI argument parsing.
  - Integrate with the existing main module and route recognized flags (e.g. `--diagnostics`, `--version`, `--dockerize`, `--toggle-allow-nan`, etc.) to their corresponding functionalities.
- **Validation and Error Handling:**
  - Use built-in JavaScript and the Zod library for schema validation of CLI arguments. Ensure that missing or malformed arguments prompt clearly defined error messages and usage instructions.
  - Provide fallback defaults for optional flags and a comprehensive help output via a `--help` flag.
- **Modularity and Extensibility:**
  - Encapsulate all parsing logic in a single source file to ease maintenance and future enhancements.
  - Ensure that additional flags can be introduced without modifying core parsing logic.
- **Integration with Existing Features:**
  - Update the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to invoke the ARG_PARSER module and transition from basic logging to structured argument resolution.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g. in `tests/unit/argParser.test.js`) to simulate different CLI inputs and edge cases, verifying that the parser outputs correctly structured argument objects.
  - Ensure tests cover scenarios such as missing required flags, invalid flag combinations, and proper routing to respective functionalities.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage examples and detailed descriptions of supported flags.

## Benefits
- **Improved CLI User Experience:**
  - Provides clear feedback for invalid inputs and eases the process of extending CLI functionality in future iterations.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:**
  - A centralized parser simplifies debugging and ensures consistent input validation across the repository.
- **Consistency Across Features:**
  - Supports and integrates with existing features by offering a unified mechanism for handling CLI flags and options, aligning with the repository's mission of robust, actionable diagnostics.
