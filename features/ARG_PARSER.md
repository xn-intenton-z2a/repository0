# ARG_PARSER Feature Enhancement

This feature updates the existing argument parser logic in the CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to recognize and dispatch common commands. It enhances functionality by adding specific behaviors for the following commands:

- **diagnostics**: Display diagnostic information or status messages.
- **version**: Report the current version of the application (sourced from `package.json`).
- **update**: Trigger an update check (or placeholder for future update logic).

## Implementation Details

1. **Source File (`src/lib/main.js`):**
   - Update the `main` function to inspect the first command-line argument.
   - When the argument matches `diagnostics`, call a function or log a message indicating that diagnostics have been initiated.
   - When the argument matches `version`, read and display the version number from `package.json` (or a hard-coded version placeholder) and log it.
   - When the argument matches `update`, provide a stub for update actions (e.g., logging that an update check is in progress).
   - For no or unrecognized commands, display a help/usage message listing the valid commands.

2. **Tests (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
   - Add tests to simulate passing each of the valid commands (`diagnostics`, `version`, `update`) and verify that the output reflects the correct behavior for each.
   - Ensure that the default case (no argument or invalid argument) results in a help message output.

3. **README Update (`README.md`):**
   - Include a new section under CLI Usage that explains the available commands and how to invoke them via npm scripts (e.g., `npm run diagnostics`, `npm run version`, `npm run check-update`).

4. **Dependencies and Scripts Update (`package.json`):**
   - Confirm that the npm scripts for `diagnostics`, `version`, and `check-update` properly point to `src/lib/main.js` with the respective arguments.
   - No additional dependencies are required.

## Benefits

- **Improved Clarity:** The CLI now provides clear feedback regarding the actions executed based on user input, aligning with best practices in CLI design.
- **Extensibility:** The updated parser structure allows for easy addition of new commands in the future without disrupting the existing logic.
- **Consistency:** The implementation adheres to the guidelines provided in CONTRIBUTING.md and supports the repository's mission by enhancing the core CLI utility.

This updated feature ensures that the repository's CLI interface is both user-friendly and aligned with the project's overall automated workflows and CI/CD integration.
