# ARG_PARSER Feature Enhancement

This feature refines the existing argument parser in the repository's CLI entry point to support differentiated commands. In addition to the basic command echo, the parser will now dispatch special commands such as `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update`. This update aligns with the repository mission of adding handy CLI utilities in Node.js and adheres to the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Overview

The CLI utility in `src/lib/main.js` will be enhanced to:

- Parse command-line arguments more clearly.
- Dispatch to dedicated functions based on recognized commands (e.g. `diagnostics`, `version`, `update`).
- Fall back to displaying a usage/help message when no argument or an invalid argument is provided.
- Ensure that running the commands via npm scripts (`npm run diagnostics`, `npm run version`, `npm run check-update`) triggers the appropriate behavior based on the provided argument.

## Implementation Details

1. **Source File (`src/lib/main.js`):**
   - Update the `main` function to inspect the first argument from `args`.
   - If the argument matches `diagnostics`, `version`, or `update`, call respective stub functions that log a message indicating the command was recognized (this can be expanded later to include actual command functions).
   - If no command is provided or the command is unrecognized, print a help message that lists the valid commands.

2. **Tests (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
   - Update tests to simulate process arguments with each of the valid commands and verify that the output indicates the corresponding behavior.
   - Ensure that the basic loading of the main module is still intact.

3. **README Update (`README.md`):**
   - Add a section that explains the CLI usage with examples. For instance, document how to run `npm run diagnostics` to trigger the diagnostics command, etc.
   
4. **Dependencies and Scripts (`package.json`):**
   - The npm scripts already reference the commands (`diagnostics`, `version`, `update`). No changes to dependencies are required, but this update reinforces their purpose by making the CLI dispatch logic more robust.

## Benefits

- **Clarity:** Users will have clear, documented commands available through the CLI.
- **Extensibility:** The structure allows future enhancements to each command without altering the basic parsing structure.
- **Consistency:** Aligns with the repository's mission and the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md, ensuring that enhancements are accompanied by tests and updated documentation.

This feature improvement is a focused iteration on the existing ARG_PARSER to deliver tangible value with minimal changes in a single repository.
