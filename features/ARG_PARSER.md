# ARG_PARSER

## Overview
This feature introduces a robust command-line argument parser for repository0. By centralizing and enhancing the parsing logic, this feature ensures that all CLI flags (such as --diagnostics, --help, --version, and others) are processed consistently and validated thoroughly. The new parser will provide clear error messages for unrecognized or conflicting flags and will serve as the single point for processing input arguments, thereby improving maintainability and clarity across the repository.

## Implementation Details
- **Module Creation:** Develop a new module (e.g. `src/lib/argParser.js`) that encapsulates the logic for parsing and validating CLI arguments.
- **Flag Validation:** Support all existing flags (such as --diagnostics, --help, --version, --color, --log-level, etc.) and enforce rules, such as mutual exclusions or required flags where applicable.
- **Error Handling:** Provide descriptive error messages for invalid or unexpected arguments. Ensure that the application exits with standardized exit codes (in line with the EXIT_CODES feature) when encountering errors.
- **Integration:** Refactor `src/lib/main.js` to import and use the new argument parser instead of directly processing `process.argv`. Maintain backward compatibility with current behavior.
- **Modularity:** Keep the argument parser self-contained to allow future enhancements (such as adding new flags) without affecting other parts of the repository.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/argParser.test.js`) covering various scenarios: valid flag combinations, unrecognized flags, and error cases. Ensure that help output is triggered correctly when the `--help` flag is supplied.
- **Edge Cases:** Validate that the parser gracefully handles cases with no arguments or with conflicting flags.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to describe the new argument parser.
- Provide usage examples and detailed explanations of flag validations as part of the CLI help output.
- Ensure that the documentation references the broader mission of repository0, which is to promote healthy collaboration and streamlined automated workflows.
