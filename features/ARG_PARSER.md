# ARG_PARSER Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement refines the argument parser logic in `src/lib/main.js` to support a more robust CLI interface. The updated parser will recognize and dispatch the following commands:

- **diagnostics**: Outputs diagnostic information about the runtime environment and current configuration.
- **version**: Reads and displays the current version of the application (sourced from `package.json`).
- **update**: Initiates a stub update check and logs an update in progress message.
- **default/invalid**: Displays a help message describing the available commands.

These changes improve usability and provide clear feedback to users, aligning with the repository's mission to deliver useful CLI utilities in a streamlined and maintainable manner.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File (`src/lib/main.js`)**
  - Update the `main` function to inspect the first command-line argument and dispatch based on its value.
  - For the `version` command, read the version from `package.json` (or use a hard-coded version if file reading is not applicable) and print it.
  - For the `diagnostics` command, log key information that may include environment variables or a status message.
  - For the `update` command, log a message indicating that an update check is in progress.
  - For any unrecognized or missing arguments, print a help/usage message listing the supported commands.

- **Test File (`tests/unit/main.test.js`)**
  - Add tests that simulate passing `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` as command-line arguments.
  - Verify that the output includes the expected messages for each command.
  - Ensure the default case prints a help message.

- **Documentation (`README.md`)**
  - Update the CLI Usage section to document the new commands and provide examples of how to invoke them via npm scripts.

- **Dependencies File (`package.json`)**
  - Confirm that the npm scripts are correctly configured to pass the required arguments for `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` commands.

## Benefits
- **Clarity and Feedback:** Users receive clear responses and guidance depending on the command used.
- **Maintainability:** The structure allows for easy addition of further commands in the future without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Alignment:** The enhancement supports the repository's mission by providing a handy CLI utility backed by unit tests and clear documentation.
