# CHAT_UNDO Feature

This feature adds an "undo" subcommand to the chat CLI utility. It allows the user to remove the last appended message from the persistent chat history file (.chat_history.json). This functionality is useful for quickly reverting any accidental chat message without manually editing the file.

## Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new branch for the `chat undo` subcommand under the main `chat` command.
- Check if the chat history file exists. If not, output "No chat history available.".
- If the file exists, parse the JSON data and check whether there is at least one message.
  - If there are messages, remove the last message from the messages array and write the updated history back to the file. Display a confirmation message such as "Last message undone.".
  - If no messages remain, display a message indicating that there are no messages to undo.
- Ensure proper error handling if the file cannot be read or written.

## Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests for the `chat undo` subcommand:
  - Test that when `chat undo` is invoked with no chat history file, the output correctly indicates the absence of chat history.
  - Test that when the chat history exists and contains one or more messages, invoking `chat undo` removes the last message and updates the file accordingly.
  - Test the scenario where the chat history contains a single message. After undoing, verify that the output indicates that no messages remain to be undone.

## README.md Updates
- Update the Chat Command section to document the new `chat undo` subcommand. Include an example command:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat undo
  ```
- Explain that the command removes the last appended message from the chat history, enabling users to quickly revert their last entry.

## Rationale
- **Usability:** Provides an easy way for users to correct accidental or unwanted chat entries.
- **Consistency:** Complements existing chat functionalities while maintaining simplicity by modifying only the source, test, and documentation files.
- **Mission Alignment:** Enhances the repository's mission to offer handy CLI utilities in Node.js by improving chat session management.
