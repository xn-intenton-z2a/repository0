# HISTORY

## Overview
This updated HISTORY feature not only logs every executed command with its metadata (timestamp, command name, input arguments, execution result, and execution duration) but also aggregates performance metrics across all command executions. In addition to the existing history log, this enhancement reports summary statistics such as the total number of commands executed, average, minimum, and maximum execution durations, and success/error rates. This integrated performance monitoring empowers users to analyze the efficiency of command execution over time and supports debugging and optimization in a collaborative environment.

## CLI Integration
- **Primary Flags:**
  - `--history` to display the full log of previously executed commands.
  - `--clear-history` to reset the command history.
  - **New Option:** An optional sub-flag `--metrics` that, when combined with `--history`, outputs aggregated performance metrics including:
    - Total number of commands executed
    - Average execution duration
    - Minimum (fastest) and maximum (slowest) execution durations
    - Count of successful and error executions

- **Output Modes:**
  - In standard text mode, the output displays a human-readable list of historical commands along with a summary performance report.
  - In JSON mode (via `--json` or `--json-pretty`), the report returns a structured JSON object with both the detailed command history and the aggregated performance metrics, ensuring consistency with the global JSON output mode.

## Implementation Details
- **Logging Mechanism:**
  - The system continues using Node’s `fs` module to append each command execution to a log file (e.g., `history.log`).
  - Each log entry includes command name, input parameters (after filtering global flags), execution timestamp, execution duration, and the result or error message.

- **Performance Aggregation:**
  - On invoking the `--history --metrics` mode, the module reads the history log and computes statistics:
    - **Total Commands:** Count all executed commands.
    - **Average Duration:** Compute the mean of all execution durations.
    - **Min/Max Duration:** Identify the fastest and slowest command executions.
    - **Success/Error Count:** Tally successes versus errors.
  - The module handles cases where the history file is empty by returning a message indicating insufficient data for performance reporting.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If the history file is inaccessible or corrupted, a clear error message is returned.
  - Input validation routines ensure that all numeric data for performance metrics are correctly parsed, with robust handling of any anomalies.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Tests verify that each command execution is correctly logged with accurate metadata.
  - Additional tests ensure that aggregated performance metrics (total count, average, min, max durations, success/error counts) are accurately computed from the history log.
  - Edge cases—such as an empty history log or malformed log entries—are handled gracefully.

- **Documentation:**
  - The README, CLI usage guides, and inline code comments have been updated to include usage examples for the new performance metrics report mode. For example:
    - Display full history: `node src/lib/main.js --history`
    - Display history with performance metrics: `node src/lib/main.js --history --metrics`
  - Detailed internal documentation explains the aggregation logic and integration with the overall command logging system.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By integrating performance metrics with historical command logging, the updated HISTORY feature enhances traceability and system insight. This improvement supports the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined automation by enabling users to monitor and optimize command execution in a self-contained, robust CLI utility.
