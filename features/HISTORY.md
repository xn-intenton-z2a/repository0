# HISTORY

## Overview
This feature implements a command history logging mechanism for the CLI tool. Every executed command, along with its metadata (timestamp, command name, input arguments, and execution result), will be recorded. Users can view the command history with a dedicated flag and reset the history if needed.

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** Introduce a new flag `--history` which, when invoked, displays the log of previously executed commands.
- **Additional Command:** A secondary flag `--clear-history` will allow users to clear the history log.
- **Output Modes:** The history output will support both standard text and JSON mode. In JSON mode (--json or --json-pretty), the history will be returned as a structured JSON array with associated metadata.

## Implementation Details
- **Logging Mechanism:**
  - Implement history logging using Node's built-in file system module (`fs`). All command executions will append a log entry to a file (e.g., `history.log`) in the repository root.
  - Each log entry will contain the command name, input parameters (after filtering global flags), execution timestamp, execution duration, and the result (or error message).
- **Reading History:**
  - The `--history` flag will read the `history.log` file and display its contents. A formatting routine will convert raw log entries into a human-friendly output or a JSON array depending on the output mode.
- **Clearing History:**
  - The `--clear-history` flag will clear the contents of the history log file.
- **Error Handling:**
  - If the history file is not accessible or missing, the feature should inform the user appropriately.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to verify that command executions correctly append to the history log.
  - Test that the `--history` command retrieves and displays the recorded history in both text and JSON formats.
  - Test that the `--clear-history` command clears the log without errors.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples on how to view and clear the command history.
  - Include inline code comments and usage examples for integrating with the logging functionality.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
Implementing the HISTORY feature enhances traceability and debugging for users. It supports healthy collaboration by providing a self-contained, modular utility that logs every command execution, thereby aiding in troubleshooting and performance monitoring while remaining compatible with the repository's mission of streamlined automation.
