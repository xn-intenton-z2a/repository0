# Overview
This feature consolidates all command-line functionalities into a single, unified CLI tools module. It merges the previously separate help message, version reporting, and diagnostics commands into one coherent implementation. The consolidated feature respects all previous behaviors while streamlining the code and documentation to ensure high reliability and ease of maintenance.

# Implementation
- Update the main source file (src/lib/main.js) to handle all CLI flags in one integrated flow.
  - When no arguments or the --help flag is provided, display a dynamic help message listing all available commands and their descriptions.
  - When the --version flag is provided, read the version information from package.json and combine it with a current timestamp for output.
  - When the --diagnostics flag is present, output detailed environment diagnostics including Node.js version, platform, and other runtime details.
  - Retain existing functionalities such as --agentic, --dry-run, --verbose, and --cli-utils with backward compatibility.

# Tests
- In the test file (tests/unit/main.test.js), update and extend test cases to:
  - Verify that running with no arguments or with --help prints the complete, dynamic help message including all CLI command descriptions.
  - Confirm that --version outputs a message including the package version and a valid current timestamp.
  - Ensure that the --diagnostics flag results in a detailed output containing Node.js and environment details.

# Documentation
- Update README.md and docs/USAGE.md to describe the unified CLI functionality. Include details on flags, expected behavior, and local testing instructions.
- Clearly document that the CLI tools now operate under one combined feature, which simplifies command handling and minimizes redundancy.
