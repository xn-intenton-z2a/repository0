# HTTP_API & NETWORK Unification and METRICS

## Overview
This feature unifies the previously separate HTTP_API and NETWORK functionalities into a single, cohesive module. The updated HTTP_API not only provides RESTful endpoints for core CLI operations (such as performing arithmetic, diagnostics, and command execution) but also integrates simple network diagnostics. In addition, this update now includes a new endpoint for aggregating and reporting command usage metrics. This consolidation streamlines the tool’s capabilities, reduces redundancy, and enhances integration with remote monitoring and automation workflows.

## API Endpoints & Network Diagnostics
- **GET /health**: Returns a basic health check message (e.g., "All systems operational.") along with metadata. This endpoint is designed for quick diagnostics similar to the original NETWORK feature.
- **POST /command**: Accepts a JSON payload containing a command and its arguments. The server processes the request as if it were supplied on the CLI and returns the result with metadata.
- **GET /config** and **GET /diagnostics**: Mirror the CLI commands, providing system configuration and diagnostic information.
- **GET /network**: Performs HTTP(S) GET requests to provided URLs and returns key metadata including response status, response time, and content length. This endpoint encapsulates the original NETWORK functionality within the unified API.

## Session History, Audit Logging & Metrics Collection
- **Audit Trail**: Every API and CLI interaction is logged with metadata (timestamp, execution duration, version, and command input). An endpoint **GET /history** retrieves this audit log, offering enhanced traceability and debugging support.
- **Metrics Aggregation (New)**: A new endpoint **GET /metrics** has been added to provide aggregated command usage statistics based on the audit log. This endpoint reports:
  - **Command Frequency**: The number of times each CLI command has been executed.
  - **Execution Durations**: Average, minimum, and maximum execution times per command.
  - **Error Statistics**: Counts of error occurrences for each command, which helps in identifying frequent issues.

## Implementation & Error Handling
- **Dynamic Command Processing**: Commands are processed in a unified manner regardless of whether they are invoked via HTTP or CLI. Global JSON modes and consistent metadata output are maintained.
- **Network Diagnostics**: Utilizes Node’s built-in HTTP/HTTPS modules. Timeouts and network errors are gracefully handled with fallback mechanisms.
- **Audit Trail & Metrics**: All interactions are recorded in an in-memory audit log (with optional file persistence). The **GET /metrics** endpoint scans this log to compute and return aggregated statistics. If the metrics aggregation fails due to I/O or processing issues, a clear error message is returned while still providing basic audit data.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error reporting for both command processing and network diagnostics. Fallback mechanisms ensure primary functionality remains available even if non-critical operations (e.g., metrics aggregation) encounter issues.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests**: Expanded tests now cover RESTful command execution, network diagnostics, audit logging, and the new metrics aggregation. Tests confirm that the **GET /metrics** endpoint accurately reports command frequency, execution durations, and error counts.
- **Documentation**: The README and CLI usage guides are updated with examples demonstrating API interactions, including the new metrics endpoint. Inline comments in the source code clarify the dynamic command processing, audit logging, and metrics aggregation logic.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By unifying HTTP_API and NETWORK functionalities and incorporating a new metrics aggregation endpoint, this feature reinforces the repository’s mission of promoting streamlined, modular CLI utilities that support automated workflows. The added metrics reporting enables proactive monitoring of command usage and performance, facilitating healthy collaboration and continuous improvement in automated environments.
