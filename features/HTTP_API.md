# HTTP_API

## Overview
This feature adds a lightweight HTTP server to the repository that exposes key CLI functionalities as endpoints. It allows users and automated systems to query diagnostics, version information, and help content via simple HTTP requests. This server is designed to run alongside the existing CLI, providing an alternative interface for CI/CD integrations or remote monitoring.

## Implementation Details
- **Server Initialization:** Utilize Node.js's built-in HTTP module to create a server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3000).
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/`: Returns a welcome message along with a brief overview of available endpoints.
  - `/diagnostics`: Outputs extended diagnostics information (as provided by the existing `--diagnostics` functionality) in JSON format.
  - `/version`: Reads and returns the version from `package.json` in both plain text and JSON formats.
  - `/help`: Provides usage information corresponding to the `--help` flag.
- **Integration:** Extend the main CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to optionally start the HTTP server when a specific flag (e.g. `--serve`) is detected. This ensures that the server runs only when intended.
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate the HTTP API functionality in a single module (e.g., `src/lib/httpApi.js`) to maintain separation of concerns and facilitate future updates or maintenance.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests (in `tests/unit/httpApi.test.js`) to verify that each endpoint responds correctly with expected data formats and status codes.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure the server handles invalid endpoints gracefully by returning appropriate error messages and status codes.
- **Performance:** Verify that starting the server does not adversely affect the performance of the core CLI functionalities.

## Documentation
- **README Update:** Add a new section in the README describing the HTTP API, its endpoints, usage examples, and configuration options.
- **Usage Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Start the application with HTTP server enabled on default port
  node src/lib/main.js --serve
  
  # Query diagnostics via HTTP
  curl http://localhost:3000/diagnostics
  ```
- **Contributing Guidelines:** Update CONTRIBUTING.md to include testing and documentation guidelines for the HTTP API feature.

This feature aligns with the mission of showcasing automated workflows and enhanced observability within the repository, providing both CLI and HTTP interfaces in a single, self-contained repository.
