# HTTP_API & NETWORK Unification

## Overview
This feature unifies the previously separate HTTP_API and NETWORK functionalities into a single, cohesive module. The updated HTTP_API not only provides RESTful endpoints for core CLI operations (such as performing arithmetic, diagnostics, and command execution) but also integrates simple network diagnostics. This consolidation streamlines the tool’s capabilities, reducing redundancy while enhancing the integration with remote monitoring and automation workflows.

## API Endpoints & Network Diagnostics
- **GET /health**: Returns a basic health check message (e.g., "All systems operational.") along with metadata. This endpoint is designed for quick diagnostics similar to the original NETWORK feature.
- **POST /command**: Accepts a JSON payload containing a command and its arguments. The server processes the request as if it were supplied on the CLI and returns the result with metadata.
- **GET /config** and **GET /diagnostics**: Mirror the CLI commands, providing system configuration and diagnostic information.
- **GET /network**: (Integrated) Performs HTTP(S) GET requests to provided URLs. It returns key metadata including response status code, response time, and content length. This endpoint encapsulates the original NETWORK functionality within the unified API.

## Session History & Audit Logging
The feature extends the original HTTP_API by including session history and audit logging. Every CLI command executed via the API (or CLI in JSON mode) is logged in an in-memory audit trail, with an optional persistence mechanism to a local file. An endpoint **GET /history** is provided to retrieve this audit log, offering enhanced traceability and debugging support.

## Implementation & Error Handling
- **Dynamic Command Processing:** Commands are processed in a unified manner regardless of whether they are invoked via HTTP or CLI. Global JSON modes and output metadata are maintained consistently.
- **Network Diagnostics:** Leveraging Node’s built-in HTTP/HTTPS modules, the API performs health checks and simple network requests, handling timeouts and network errors gracefully.
- **Audit Trail:** All API and CLI interactions are logged with metadata (timestamp, execution duration, version, and command input), enhancing traceability.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error reporting for both command processing and network diagnostics is ensured, with fallback mechanisms in place to maintain primary functionality even when non-critical operations (e.g., logging) fail.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Expanded tests now cover both RESTful command execution and network diagnostics, ensuring that the integrated endpoints function as expected.
- **Documentation:** Updated README and CLI usage guides include examples demonstrating both API interactions and network health checks. Inline comments provide clarity regarding dynamic command execution and audit logging.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By unifying HTTP_API and NETWORK functionalities, this feature reinforces the repository’s mission of promoting streamlined, modular CLI utilities that empower automated workflows. The enhancement simplifies the overall system design and improves user experience in both local and remote (HTTP-based) interactions.
