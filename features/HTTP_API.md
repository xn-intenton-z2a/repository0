# HTTP_API & NETWORK Unification, METRICS, and CLI METRICS

## Overview
This feature unifies HTTP API endpoints and network diagnostics while extending its functionality to include aggregated metrics reporting. In addition to the existing RESTful endpoints (e.g., /health, /command, /config, /diagnostics, /network, /history, and /metrics), the feature has been refined to also support a CLI mode for metrics reporting via a new "--metrics" flag. This dual approach reinforces our mission of streamlined automation and healthy collaboration by providing both remote and local insights into command usage, execution times, and error statistics.

## API Endpoints & Network Diagnostics
- **GET /health:** Returns a health check message with metadata (status, timestamp, version).
- **POST /command:** Accepts a JSON payload with a command and arguments, processes it similarly to CLI, and returns results with metadata.
- **GET /config & /diagnostics:** Provide system configuration and diagnostic information, mirroring CLI commands.
- **GET /network:** Conducts HTTP(S) GET requests to specified URLs and returns status, response time, and content length.
- **GET /history:** Retrieves the complete audit log of CLI and API interactions.
- **GET /metrics:** Aggregates command usage statistics (frequency, execution durations, error counts) from the audit log and returns these metrics in JSON format.

## CLI Metrics Reporting
- A new global flag `--metrics` has been added to the CLI tool. When invoked, it aggregates the same audit log data used by the API endpoint and outputs a structured metrics report directly on the command line.
- **Output Modes:**
  - In plain text mode, the report details command frequency, average/minimum/maximum execution durations, and error statistics.
  - In JSON mode (activated with `--json` or `--json-pretty`), the output includes detailed metadata with fields such as timestamp, tool version, and aggregated statistics.

## Implementation & Error Handling
- **Unified Command Processing:** Both HTTP API and CLI commands use the same central processing logic so that metrics data is aggregated consistently, regardless of the invocation method.
- **Audit Log Integration:** Every CLI and API interaction is logged with metadata including timestamp, execution duration, version, and input. The metrics aggregation function scans this log to compute statistics and is designed to handle any I/O errors gracefully by providing fallback messages.
- **Error Reporting:** In case of failure during metrics aggregation (e.g., log retrieval issues), a clear error message is displayed, but primary CLI/API functions remain available.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Expanded tests cover both HTTP endpoints and CLI invocations of the `--metrics` flag to ensure that metrics are accurately computed and formatted.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides are updated to show examples for both HTTP API and CLI metrics commands:
  - HTTP API: `GET /metrics`
  - CLI: `node src/lib/main.js --metrics` (optionally combined with `--json` or `--json-pretty`)
- **Inline Comments:** The source code in `src/lib/main.js` includes documentation explaining how audit logs are processed and how metrics are generated.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging HTTP API, network diagnostics, and real-time CLI metrics reporting into a single cohesive feature, this update enhances transparency, traceability, and automated monitoring of the CLI tool. This consolidation not only streamlines functionality but also supports healthy collaboration by providing immediate feedback on system performance and usage trends.
