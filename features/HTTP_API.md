# HTTP_API

## Overview
This feature introduces an HTTP API endpoint for the repository0 CLI tool. In addition to the current command-line functionality, users can now interact with the tool via RESTful HTTP calls. The API exposes a subset of core CLI operations (e.g., arithmetic, statistical computations, diagnostics, and configuration) and returns responses in JSON format with full metadata. This extension facilitates integration with web services, automated workflows, and remote monitoring.

## API Endpoints
- **GET /health**: Returns a basic healthcheck message (e.g., "All systems operational.") along with metadata.
- **POST /command**: Accepts a JSON payload containing a command (e.g., "--sum") and its arguments. The server processes the request as if it were passed to the CLI and returns the result with metadata (timestamp, executionDuration, inputEcho, version, warnings, etc.).
- **Configuration & Diagnostics**: Endpoints such as `GET /config` and `GET /diagnostics` mirror the respective CLI commands.

## Implementation Details
- **Server Setup**: Implement a lightweight HTTP server using Node.js’ built-in `http` module. The server listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3000) and so can be triggered with a new CLI flag (e.g., `--serve`).
- **Routing**: A simple routing mechanism maps HTTP requests to internal CLI command functions. The server interprets the JSON body of POST requests to extract the command and parameters.
- **Response Handling**: Responses are returned in JSON format, including all standard metadata as produced by the CLI in JSON mode (timestamp, version, executionDuration, inputEcho, and results).
- **Error Management**: Invalid commands and malformed requests result in clear HTTP error responses (400 series), with JSON error details echoing the CLI behavior.
- **Configuration**: Allow port customization via environment variables or command line parameters (e.g., `--port 8080`).

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests**: Should simulate HTTP GET and POST requests to the server and verify JSON responses, ensuring that outputs match those from the command-line execution.
- **Integration Tests**: Focus on end-to-end API behavior including error conditions and concurrent requests.
- **Documentation**: Update the README and API usage guides to include examples on how to interact with the HTTP API, including sample curl commands and Postman collections.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The HTTP_API feature extends repository0’s usefulness by allowing remote, automated, and programmatic access to its CLI capabilities. This addition promotes healthy collaboration and integration into modern web-based automation workflows, staying true to the mission of providing modular, self-contained utilities.
