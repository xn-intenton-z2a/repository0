# COLORIZE

## Overview
The COLORIZE feature introduces configurable colored output for the CLI tool’s plain text responses. In non-JSON mode, this feature will enhance readability by applying color codes to output messages such as errors, warnings, and success messages. By clearly distinguishing message types using colors (e.g., red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for success), it provides an improved, user-friendly interface without impacting machine-readable JSON output.

## CLI Integration
- **Activation:** The feature activates by default in plain text mode. Optionally, users can disable colored output via a new flag (e.g., `--no-color`).
- **Message Types:**
  - **Success:** Displayed in green.
  - **Warnings:** Displayed in yellow.
  - **Errors:** Displayed in red.
- **Configuration:** Users can customize color schemes via environment variables (e.g., `SUCCESS_COLOR`, `WARNING_COLOR`, `ERROR_COLOR`) if needed.

## Implementation Details
- **Color Library:** Utilize a lightweight library (or manual ANSI codes) to inject color codes into output strings when the terminal supports them.
- **Fallback:** If the output is piped or if the `--json` flag is provided, colorization is automatically disabled to ensure clean output.
- **Integration:** Enhance existing output helper functions (e.g., `sendSuccess` and `sendError`) to conditionally wrap text with ANSI escape sequences based on the message type and configuration.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to verify that the correct ANSI codes are applied under plain text mode and that disabling colors via `--no-color` produces uncolored output. Include tests to ensure JSON mode outputs remain unaffected.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples and configuration options for colorized output. Inline code comments will explain the logic for color switching and fallback.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
COLORIZE enhances user experience by delivering clearer, more engaging command-line output. This self-contained upgrade aligns with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation by making diagnostic and operational information easier to parse at a glance.
