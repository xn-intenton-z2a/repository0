# SETTINGS

## Overview
This feature introduces a persistent settings management system for repository0. In addition to dynamic environment configuration provided by CONFIG_HANDLER, the SETTINGS feature enables the storage and retrieval of user-specific preferences and options via a JSON file (e.g. `settings.json`). By offering a simple CLI interface to access and update these settings, the repository empowers users to customize behavior across sessions while preserving consistency with the underlying mission of promoting automated, reproducible workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **Persistent Storage:**
  - Store configuration key-value pairs in a `settings.json` file located at the project root.
  - On startup, the system loads default settings if the file does not exist, ensuring that a baseline configuration is always available.
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce new CLI flags: 
    - `--get-setting <key>` to retrieve a specific setting value.
    - `--set-setting <key> <value>` to update a setting persistently.
  - Extend `src/lib/main.js` to recognize and route these commands to a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/settings.js`).
- **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - Validate JSON integrity when reading from or writing to the file, handling errors such as malformed JSON or permission issues gracefully.
  - Provide clear error messages and fallback to default settings when necessary.
- **Modularity:**
  - Encapsulate all settings-related logic within a single module to promote maintainability and future extensibility (e.g., adding commands like resetting to defaults or merging configuration profiles).

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g. in `tests/unit/settings.test.js`) to simulate reading and writing operations on the settings file.
  - Cover edge cases including file access errors, missing keys, and invalid JSON formats.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include detailed usage instructions and examples.
- Provide CLI usage examples:
  ```bash
  # Retrieve a setting, for example the current theme
  node src/lib/main.js --get-setting theme

  # Update the theme setting to 'dark'
  node src/lib/main.js --set-setting theme dark
  ```
- Document the default settings structure and guidelines for manual configuration adjustments if required.

This feature aligns with the repository's mission by enhancing user experience and fostering persistent, customizable configuration across sessions.
