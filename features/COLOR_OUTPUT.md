# COLOR_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature introduces colorized CLI output for the repository. By enabling a `--color` flag, users can enjoy enhanced readability and visual feedback on CLI messages (e.g., success messages in green, errors in red, and warnings in yellow). The color output improves clarity for both human users and automated systems that parse logs, reflecting the repositoryâ€™s mission of interactive and actionable feedback.

## Implementation Details
- **Flag Detection:** Update the CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect a new flag `--color`. When this flag is supplied, CLI outputs (help, diagnostics, version, etc.) will be formatted with ANSI color codes.
- **Color Utility Module:** Implement a lightweight color utility as a separate module (e.g. `src/lib/colorOutput.js`) using ANSI escape sequences. This module will expose helper functions for different message types:
  - `info(text)` for informational messages (blue/green)
  - `error(text)` for error messages (red)
  - `warning(text)` for warnings (yellow)
- **Integration:** Integrate the color utility with existing output routines in features like USAGE_HELP, VERSION_OUTPUT, and OUTPUT_FORMAT. If the `--color` flag is not provided or if the terminal does not support colors, fall back to plain text output.
- **Self-Containment:** Ensure the new functionality is isolated within its module and does not affect other features. Document clear usage instructions linking back to the repository's overall guidelines.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/colorOutput.test.js`) to verify that the color helper functions correctly wrap text with the expected ANSI codes.
- **Edge Cases:** Test behavior when the `--color` flag is absent and ensure that disabling color output works as expected.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING Updates:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include examples of the `--color` flag usage:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --color --diagnostics
  ```
- **Usage Examples:** Provide examples in the CLI help text showing colored output to enhance user experience.

This feature is designed to be achieved in a single repository without introducing excessive dependencies, fitting well within the mission of providing actionable, human-friendly outputs while supporting automated workflows.
