# COLOR_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature introduces colored output formatting for the CLI tool. By leveraging ANSI escape codes, it enhances terminal readability by applying color styles to success messages, error messages, and warnings. This feature can be toggled via a new global flag (e.g., `--color`) and will be disabled in JSON output mode to preserve machine readability.

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag:** Introduce a new flag `--color` to enable colorful terminal outputs. When this flag is active, all console messages (success, error, warnings, and informational outputs) will include visual enhancements using color codes.
- **Conditional Behavior:** In standard text mode, colored output is applied. In JSON mode (when `--json` or `--json-pretty` is used), the messages are output in plain text without ANSI codes.

## Implementation Details
- **Styling Functions:** Implement helper functions that wrap messages with ANSI escape sequences. For example, successful messages might be shown in green, errors in red, and warnings in yellow.
- **Integration with Existing Logic:** Modify the existing output functions (`sendSuccess` and `sendError`) to conditionally apply color formatting when the `--color` flag is active. This should not interfere with metadata or JSON output.
- **Configuration & Fallbacks:** The feature should detect if the terminal supports ANSI colors. If not, it should automatically fall back to plain text output, even if the flag is provided.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to verify that when `--color` is provided, messages include the appropriate ANSI codes. Also, verify that JSON mode remains unaffected.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides to include examples of using the `--color` flag. Document the color schemes used and provide guidance on environments where colored output may not be supported.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By enhancing the CLI tool's usability through improved readability and user feedback, the COLOR_OUTPUT feature supports streamlined automation and fosters healthy collaboration. The clear visual distinctions in output help users quickly identify results and errors, aligning with the mission of making the tool accessible and efficient.
