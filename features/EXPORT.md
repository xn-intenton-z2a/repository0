# EXPORT

## Overview
The EXPORT feature allows users to persist the output of any CLI command to a specified file. By providing a simple global flag, users can export command results in their desired format format (plain text, JSON, or CSV), enabling easy integration with other tools and workflows. This feature enhances automation and traceability while staying true to the repository's mission of fostering healthy collaboration through modular and practical CLI utilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global flag `--export` that takes a file path as an argument. Optionally, an additional flag `--export-format` can be provided to specify the export format (default is plain text; alternatives are JSON and CSV).
- **Behavior:** When the `--export` flag is active alongside any other command, the CLI tool writes the final output (along with additional metadata in JSON mode) to the specified file. This file is appended with each command execution, enabling an audit-like log of operations.
- **Usage Example:**
  - `node src/lib/main.js --sum 3 4 5 --export results.txt`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --json --multiply 2 3 4 --export output.json --export-format json`

## Implementation Details
- **Result Processing:** The CLI will check for the presence of the `--export` flag after executing any command. If present, it formats the result according to the specified export format and appends it to the provided file.
- **File Handling:** Utilizes Node's fs module to synchronously write to or append data to the export file. Error handling ensures that file permission or access errors are caught and reported back to the user without disrupting the normal CLI operation.
- **Optional Format Flag:** The `--export-format` flag controls the output data format. If not provided, defaults to plain text. When set to JSON or CSV, the output is formatted accordingly.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Validates that the provided file path is accessible and writable before attempting to export data.
- Provides clear error messages if the file cannot be written or if the format specified is unsupported.
- Ensures that exporting does not interfere with the normal CLI output in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate command execution with the `--export` flag to verify that outputs are correctly written and formatted in the target file.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage documentation to include examples and usage instructions. Inline code comments document the logic for file export operations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The EXPORT feature aligns with the repository’s mission by enhancing the tool’s utility and facilitating automated workflows. By allowing users to archive and analyze command outputs, it promotes robust, modular automation practices essential for healthy collaborative development.
