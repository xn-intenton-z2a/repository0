# Benchmark

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight performance benchmarking tool into the repository. It allows developers to run a set of timed tests on core CLI operations (such as project initialization, dependency report generation, and diagnostics retrieval) to assess and monitor performance.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new flag `--benchmark` in the main CLI (e.g. in `src/lib/main.js`). When this flag is provided, the application will execute a series of benchmark tests rather than the normal operations.
  - Optionally support a `--json` flag to output the benchmarking results in a structured JSON format, allowing integration into CI/CD pipelines and automated performance tracking.

- **Benchmark Execution:**
  - Implement the benchmarking logic in a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/benchmark.js`). This module will measure the execution time of various operations using Node.jsâ€™s built-in timing functions (`console.time` / `console.timeEnd` or `process.hrtime`).
  - The module should simulate or trigger core operations (such as a dry-run of project initialization, dependency report scanning, and diagnostics processing) to measure their performance and report the timing in milliseconds.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - When run in standard mode, display a human-readable summary of the timings, including the name of each operation and its duration.
  - In JSON mode, output a JSON object that maps each operation to its measured time along with metadata such as a timestamp and repository version.

- **Error Handling and Modularity:**
  - Ensure robust error handling in case any operation fails or takes longer than expected. The benchmarking tool should gracefully handle such exceptions and log diagnostic messages.
  - Keep the entire benchmarking logic self-contained in a single source file to make it easy to maintain, extend, and test.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop tests (e.g. in `tests/unit/benchmark.test.js`) that simulate the benchmarking procedure and validate that timing results are accurate and reported in the correct format (plain text and JSON).
  - Simulate edge cases such as operations that exceed expected time thresholds to ensure that the module logs appropriate warnings.

## Benefits
- **Performance Insights:** Provides developers with actionable data on the performance of key CLI operations.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Enables automated performance tracking by outputting benchmarking data in JSON format, facilitating performance regression monitoring.
- **Lightweight and Self-contained:** Achievable within a single module and repository, without requiring external dependencies or complex infrastructure.
