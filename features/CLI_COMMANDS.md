# CLI_COMMANDS Feature Specification Update

This update enhances the CLI tool's command routing mechanism by adding support for the additional commands: diagnostics, version, and update. The goal is to deliver immediate value by ensuring that the commands defined in package.json are fully supported in the CLI tool, eliminating the current fallback to an unknown command message.

## Overview

This feature update augments the existing CLI_COMMANDS feature specification so that the commands "diagnostics", "version", and "update" are processed correctly in the main CLI entry point. When users invoke these commands, the CLI will:

- **diagnostics:** Output a message indicating system health, e.g., "Diagnostics: System operational".
- **version:** Display the repository version (e.g., "Version: 1.4.1-13").
- **update:** Simulate an update check by printing a message such as "Checking for updates... No updates available".

This update ensures that the CLI adheres to the documented behavior in CLI_COMMANDS.md and aligns with the repository's mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Command Routing Update:**
  - Detect when the first argument matches "diagnostics", "version", or "update".
  - For "diagnostics": Output `Diagnostics: System operational`.
  - For "version": Output `Version: 1.4.1-13` (hard-coded to match the current version in package.json).
  - For "update": Print `Checking for updates... No updates available`.
  - Retain the existing implementations for commands such as `greet`, `gcd`, `lcm`, and `prime`.
  - Continue providing an error message for any unknown command other than the three new commands.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Cases:**
  - Add tests to simulate running the CLI with the "diagnostics" command and verify that the correct diagnostics message is printed.
  - Add tests for the "version" command to check that the expected version output is displayed.
  - Add tests for the "update" command to ensure that the simulated update check message is printed.
  - Ensure that these additions do not interfere with the existing tests for other commands.

### README File (README.md):
- **Usage Documentation Update:**
  - Update the CLI usage section to include examples for the three new commands:
    - `node src/lib/main.js diagnostics`
    - `node src/lib/main.js version`
    - `node src/lib/main.js update`
  - Clearly document the expected outputs for these commands.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No New Dependencies:**
  - Utilize the same libraries and mechanisms already present in the repository.
  - Ensure consistency with the existing scripts that reference these commands (diagnostics, version, check-update).

## Benefits

- **Enhanced CLI Functionality:** Users receive clear, dedicated outputs for diagnostics, version, and update commands, ensuring that package.json scripts work as intended.
- **Improved User Experience:** Immediate feedback for these common queries increases the usability and professionalism of the CLI tool.
- **Consistency:** The implementation is aligned with the repository's mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js and consolidates the command routing logic in a single, well-defined module.
