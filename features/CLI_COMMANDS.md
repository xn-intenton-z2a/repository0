# CLI_COMMANDS Feature Specification Update

This update enhances the CLI tool's command routing mechanism by fully supporting the commands defined in package.json. In addition to the existing diagnostics command, this update adds implementations for the "version" and "update" commands. These additions ensure that when users invoke the CLI tool with these commands, they receive clear and appropriate responses.

## Overview

The updated CLI_COMMANDS feature now includes:
- **diagnostics:** Outputs a message indicating system health (already implemented).
- **version:** Outputs the repository version (hard-coded to match package.json, e.g., "Version: 1.4.1-13").
- **update:** Simulates an update check by printing a message such as "Checking for updates... No updates available".

These changes align with the repository's mission of offering handy CLI utilities in Node.js and ensure that all commands defined in the documentation and package scripts are consistently handled in the main CLI entry point.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js)
- **Command Routing:**
  - Update the main function to detect when the first argument matches "version" or "update".
  - For "version":
    - Print the version string (e.g., "Version: 1.4.1-13").
  - For "update":
    - Print the message "Checking for updates... No updates available".
  - Retain the implementation of the diagnostics command and ensure the unknown command branch continues to function for any unsupported commands.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **New Test Cases:**
  - Add test cases to simulate running the CLI with the "version" command and verify it outputs the correct version string.
  - Add test cases for the "update" command to check that the proper update check message is printed.

### README File (README.md)
- **Usage Section Update:**
  - Update the examples to include usage of the "version" and "update" commands, explaining their outputs.

### Dependencies File (package.json)
- **No Additional Dependencies:**
  - The feature utilizes existing libraries and aligns with the current scripts provided in package.json.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced CLI Functionality:** Users receive dedicated outputs for diagnostics, version, and update commands, ensuring a more polished CLI experience.
- **Improved User Experience:** Clear feedback for frequently used commands increases usability and professionalism.
- **Consistency:** The implementation consolidates command routing logic, ensuring all supported commands are handled as documented.
