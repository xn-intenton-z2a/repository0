# CONFIG_WATCHER

## Overview
This feature extends the current configuration loader functionality by adding dynamic monitoring of environment configuration files. With CONFIG_WATCHER enabled, the application will observe changes to the `.env` file and automatically reload configuration values at runtime. This ensures that updates to environment variables are propagated without restarting the application, aligning with the templateâ€™s goal of streamlined, automated workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **File Monitoring:** Utilize Node.js's `fs.watch` or a similar mechanism to monitor the `.env` file for changes. On detecting modifications, trigger a reload of configuration values.
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a new flag (`--watch-config`) that enables the dynamic monitoring feature. When provided, the application should instantiate the watcher after the initial configuration load.
- **Event Notification:** Implement an event emitter to broadcast configuration changes to other modules. This can be used to update diagnostics or reinitialize dependent subsystems.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure that any errors during file monitoring (e.g., file access issues) are logged clearly without interrupting the main application flow.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to simulate changes in the `.env` file and verify that configuration values update accordingly. Include tests to handle file access errors or missing files gracefully.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate that enabling the `--watch-config` flag correctly initializes the watcher and that configuration changes trigger the appropriate reload events.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING guides to include information about dynamic configuration reloading.
- Provide usage examples demonstrating how to run the application with the `--watch-config` flag:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --watch-config
  ```
- Document the expected behavior in the case of configuration updates, and detail troubleshooting tips for file monitoring errors.
