# MATH Feature Consolidation with Caching

## Overview
The new MATH feature consolidates mathematical operations that were previously split across the TRIGONOMETRY, EXPRESSION, and SOLVER modules into one unified, cohesive module. In addition to unifying trigonometric functions, real and complex expression evaluations, and algebraic solving (including quadratic equations and 2x2 matrix operations), this update integrates a result caching mechanism. The caching layer optimizes performance for computationally intensive tasks by storing and reusing results based on the input parameters.

## CLI Integration
- **Unified Access:** A new CLI flag (e.g., `--math`) replaces individual flags for trigonometry, expression evaluation, and solving. Users can now perform all math operations from a single command.
- **Caching Option:** An additional global flag `--cache` enables caching. When active, before executing any math operation, the module checks an in-memory (optionally file-backed) cache using a key generated from the command and its input parameters.
  - **Cache Hit:** Returns the stored result immediately with an indication that the cached value is used.
  - **Cache Miss:** Proceeds with the computation, stores the output in the cache, and returns the result.

## Implementation Details
- **Consolidated Math Operations:**
  - **Trigonometric Functions:** Includes basic (sin, cos, tan) and hyperbolic functions, along with their inverses.
  - **Expression Evaluation:** Safely computes arithmetic expressions and handles complex numbers.
  - **Algebraic Solvers:** Solves quadratic equations and performs 2x2 matrix operations (addition, multiplication, determinant, inverse).

- **Result Caching:**
  - **Mechanism:** Utilizes a simple hashing strategy on the command and parameters to check for cached results.
  - **Persistence:** Offers an in-memory store with an optional persistent JSON file for storing cache entries across sessions.
  - **Error Handling:** If caching fails (e.g., due to I/O issues), the system logs a warning and executes the computation normally.

## Error Handling & Validation
- All inputs undergo strict validation to ensure correct format and validity.
- Caching errors, if any, are handled gracefully without interrupting the core computation.
- Standardized error messages and warnings remain consistent with existing CLI behavior.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Will cover both the unified math operations and caching functionality, ensuring correct results and proper cache utilization.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated to include examples of using the `--math` flag with and without the `--cache` option, along with details about cache configuration.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By unifying multiple math functionalities and introducing an efficient caching mechanism, the MATH feature enhances modularity, reduces redundancy, and improves performance. This consolidation supports the repositoryâ€™s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and practical automation through streamlined, self-contained CLI utilities.
