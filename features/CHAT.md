# CHAT

## Overview
This updated CHAT feature integrates a new CLI command `--chat` which enables users to interact with the Chat Completions API directly from the terminal. This command broadens the repositoryâ€™s capabilities, allowing rapid prototyping and testing conversational queries, thus aligning with our mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined automation.

## Implementation Details
- **Command Integration:**
  - Update `src/lib/main.js` to add a new flag `--chat` to the command mapping.
  - Ensure that the command accepts a string query parameter. If no query is provided, output a standardized error message.

- **API Interaction:**
  - Utilize the OpenAI library to send the user's query to the Chat Completions API.
  - The API key should be securely read from the environment variable `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY`.
  - Handle successful responses by displaying plain text output by default, or JSON output if the global JSON modes (`--json` or `--json-pretty`) are active.
  - Include additional metadata such as a timestamp and execution duration when in JSON mode.

- **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - Validate that a non-empty query is provided. If not, return an error message like "Error: No query provided for chat interaction.".
  - If the API call fails (e.g., due to network issues or an invalid API key), catch the error and display a standardized error message.

- **Testing & Documentation:**
  - Write unit tests simulating both valid and error scenarios for chat queries.
  - Document usage examples in the README, e.g., `node src/lib/main.js --chat "What is the weather today?"`.
  - Add inline comments within `src/lib/main.js` where the new command is integrated, explaining API interactions and error handling routines.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
This enhancement enriches the repository by adding modern API interaction capabilities to the CLI tool. By offering a quick testing mechanism for Chat Completions, it not only promotes innovative experimentation but also exemplifies the modular, single-file utility approach that is central to our mission.
