# FILE_LOGGING

## Overview
This feature introduces a simple file-based logging system to complement the repository’s CLI output. By enabling file logging via a new flag, users can persist the execution logs, including command invocations, timestamps, and error messages. This functionality is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing diagnostics and CI/CD workflows, providing an audit trail for debugging and process evaluation.

## Implementation Details
- **Flag Detection:** Enhance the CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect a new flag, for example `--log-file <filename>`. When detected, all output (including diagnostics, error messages, and system info) will be appended to the specified file.
- **File Logging Module:** Implement logging in a dedicated module (e.g. `src/lib/fileLogger.js`) that provides functions to write log entries with timestamps.
- **Integration:** Update main execution flow to initialize the logger if the flag is present. Ensure log files are created if they do not exist and follow a standardized format (JSON or simple line entries) for consistency.
- **Error Handling:** Log any logging failures to the console without interrupting normal execution. Provide fallback behavior if the file cannot be written.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests in `tests/unit/fileLogger.test.js` to verify that log entries are correctly written to a file when the `--log-file` flag is provided.
- **Edge Cases:** Include tests to handle missing or unwritable file paths, ensuring that the system gracefully reverts to console logging.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING:** Update documentation to include information about the `--log-file` flag along with usage examples. 
- **Usage Example:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --log-file logs/output.log
  ```
- **CI/CD Integration:** Document how log files can be used for debugging purposes in automated workflows.

This feature supports the repository’s mission by enhancing observability and debugging capabilities, ensuring users have detailed insights into each CLI invocation and system event.
