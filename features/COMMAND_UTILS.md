# COMMAND_UTILS

## Overview
This feature consolidates two related functionalities — command aliasing and command history tracking — into a single, cohesive module. By merging the COMMAND_ALIAS and COMMAND_HISTORY features, the repository streamlines command management for both alias substitution and historical tracking, thus reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

## Implementation Details
- **Alias Management:**
  - Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `aliases.json`) at the repository root that maps user-defined aliases to full command sequences.
  - Enhance the CLI argument parser (in `src/lib/argParser.js` or similar) to recognize and substitute aliases from the configuration file before dispatching commands.
  - Implement robust handling for unrecognized or malformed alias entries to ensure the CLI falls back to normal execution with clear error messages.

- **Command History Tracking:**
  - Integrate a history recording mechanism that logs each executed command with its arguments and timestamp. Entries are appended to a file (e.g., `history.json`) located at the project root.
  - Provide an optional CLI flag (e.g., `--show-history`) that displays the recorded history in a clear format for user review and debugging.
  - Ensure that file access errors in the history module do not interrupt normal CLI operations.

- **Modularity & Integration:**
  - Combine the aliasing and history functionality into a single module (e.g., `src/lib/commandUtils.js`) to minimize code duplication and centralize command-related operations.
  - Refactor the main CLI workflow (in `src/lib/main.js`) to invoke the combined module, ensuring smooth and transparent integration without affecting other repository features.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create comprehensive tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/commandUtils.test.js`) to verify correct alias substitution under various scenarios including valid, missing, and malformed alias definitions.
  - Test the history recording functionality to confirm that executed commands are accurately logged with proper timestamps.

## Documentation
- Update user guides and the README to reflect the consolidated functionality, including instructions on how to configure aliasing via `aliases.json` and how to review the command history with the `--show-history` flag.
- Provide usage examples and troubleshooting guidelines to assist both new and experienced users.

This unified approach to command management supports the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration by making command execution more intuitive and traceable.
