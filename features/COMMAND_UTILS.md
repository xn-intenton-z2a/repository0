# COMMAND_UTILS

## Overview
This feature consolidates multiple command-related functionalities including alias management, command history tracking, and introduces a centralized CLI routing mechanism. The addition of CLI routing streamlines the processing of command-line arguments, ensuring that all features (such as PROJECT_INIT, CHANGELOG, INFO, and others) are uniformly invoked through a single, maintainable entry point. This update aligns with the repository’s mission to support healthy collaboration by simplifying the CLI’s operation and error handling.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized Routing:**
  - Implement a new module (e.g. `src/lib/cliRouter.js`) responsible for parsing CLI arguments, validating flags, and dispatching commands to the appropriate modules.
  - Integrate alias substitution from the existing `aliases.json` configuration before command dispatch.
  - Ensure the router validates input and handles errors uniformly, returning standardized exit codes (as defined in the EXIT_CODES feature).

- **Alias Management and History Tracking:**
  - Retain and enhance the current alias mapping functionality, allowing user-defined shortcuts to be translated into full command sequences.
  - Log executed commands with timestamps into `history.json` for traceability and diagnostics.

- **Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI file (`src/lib/main.js`) to delegate all command processing to the new CLI router.
  - Ensure compatibility with interactive modes and existing features (such as project initialization, changelog generation, and diagnostics) by routing their respective flags appropriately.

- **Modularity & Maintainability:**
  - Consolidate all CLI-related operations into a single, cohesive module to minimize redundant code and simplify future enhancements.
  - Provide clear error messages and help output when invalid commands or flags are detected.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to simulate a variety of CLI inputs and ensure the router correctly parses and dispatches commands.
  - Verify integration with alias resolution and command history recording.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Test the handling of missing or malformed CLI arguments to ensure appropriate error notifications and standardized exit codes are returned.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage examples demonstrating the new CLI routing system.
- Provide detailed instructions on how legacy commands are processed via the router, along with examples of common command sequences.

## Benefits
- **Simplified CLI Process:** Centralizes and streamlines command parsing and execution, reducing the complexity of the main entry point.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** Unifies command management, making it easier to extend and debug CLI functionalities in the future.
- **Improved User Experience:** Offers consistent behavior across all CLI operations, ensuring clear, actionable error messages and help output.
