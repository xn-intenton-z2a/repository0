# WORKFLOWS

## Overview
This feature introduces CLI commands that allow users to view and manage GitHub workflow files directly from the repository. It lists all workflows present in the `.github/workflows` directory, displays basic file information, and (optionally) provides details on each workflow. This integration aligns with the repository's mission of showcasing automated CI/CD workflows and supports developers in reviewing and verifying workflow configurations effortlessly.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new flag, for example `--workflows`, that when invoked, triggers the workflow management module.
  - Optionally support flags such as `--json` to output the list of workflows in a structured format.

- **Workflow Discovery:**
  - Scan the `.github/workflows` directory using Node.js’s built-in `fs` and `path` modules to list available workflow files.
  - For each workflow file, extract basic metadata (e.g., filename, a brief description if available through comments at the top, and last modified timestamp).

- **Command Execution:**
  - When the `--workflows` flag is active, display the discovered workflows in a user-friendly list. In interactive mode, allow users to choose a workflow to view more detailed contents or trigger a manual run if integrated with GitHub Actions API in the future.
  - Ensure that the command does not interfere with existing CLI operations and gracefully handles errors (e.g., missing directory or permission issues).

- **Modularity and Maintainability:**
  - Encapsulate all functionality within a single source file (e.g. `src/lib/workflows.js`) to maintain simplicity and ease of contribution.
  - Include robust error handling and logging (integrated with the existing LOGGING feature) to provide clear diagnostic messages if issues arise during file scanning or execution.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Simulate different directory states (presence of workflows, empty directory) using mocks or temporary file setups.
  - Validate that the correct workflows are listed in both plain text and JSON output modes.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Handle scenarios where the `.github/workflows` directory does not exist or is inaccessible, ensuring the CLI provides a clear message rather than crashing.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include usage examples:
  ```bash
  # List available GitHub workflows in plain text
  node src/lib/main.js --workflows

  # List available GitHub workflows in JSON format
  node src/lib/main.js --workflows --json
  ```
- Provide guidelines for contributors on how to extend workflow metadata extraction in the future.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Visibility:** Immediately shows which CI/CD workflows are configured in the repository, supporting transparency and quick diagnostics.
- **Ease of Management:** Simplifies the process of reviewing and possibly managing workflows from the CLI without manually browsing the filesystem.
- **Alignment with Mission:** Directly supports the repository’s goal of demonstrating robust, automated CI/CD workflows and healthy collaboration practices.
