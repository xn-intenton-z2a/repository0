# COMMAND_ROUTER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI by implementing a command router that dispatches various commands based on the first argument passed to the CLI. In addition to the existing HELP_MENU functionality, the router supports commands such as `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update`. This update ensures that the repositoryâ€™s CLI becomes more versatile while continuing to adhere to the mission of delivering handy CLI utilities in Node.js.

## Implementation Details
1. **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
   - Update the `main` function to inspect the first argument provided to the CLI.
   - Implement a switch-case (or if-else) logic to route commands:
     - If the argument is `diagnostics`, output diagnostic information (e.g., system info, or a placeholder message).
     - If the argument is `version`, print the current version (read from package.json or hard-coded as per repository version).
     - If the argument is `update` (or `check-update`), output a message indicating that update checking is in progress.
     - For any unrecognized command, fall back to the default behavior (printing the received arguments).
   - Ensure that the logic does not interfere with the existing help functionality.

2. **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
   - Add tests to verify that calling the CLI with `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` returns the expected output.
   - Ensure that tests pass without errors when no arguments or unrecognized arguments are provided.

3. **README File Update (README.md):**
   - Add a new section under the CLI Usage or Commands section documenting the added commands (`diagnostics`, `version`, `update`).
   - Include usage examples demonstrating how to invoke these commands:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js diagnostics
     node src/lib/main.js version
     node src/lib/main.js update
     ```

4. **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
   - No new dependencies are required as the functionality is achieved with standard Node.js features.

## Usage Examples
- Run diagnostics:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js diagnostics
  ```
- Check the version:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js version
  ```
- Trigger an update check:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js update
  ```

## Benefits
- **Improved CLI Utility:** Provides users with a more robust CLI that can handle multiple commands.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Clearly defined commands help users quickly access different functionalities such as diagnostics, version info, and update checking.
- **Maintainability:** Centralizes command handling within a single function, making future enhancements straightforward.

## Rollout
This feature can be rolled out as a minor patch update. All changes are limited to existing files: source (`src/lib/main.js`), tests (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), README (`README.md`), and dependency definitions (`package.json`).
