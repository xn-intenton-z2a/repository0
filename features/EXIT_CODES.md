# EXIT_CODES

## Overview
This feature introduces a standardized set of exit codes for the CLI application. The goal is to provide clear and consistent feedback for different types of execution outcomes (success, various error conditions, and signal terminations). This aligns with the repositoryâ€™s mission to promote healthy collaboration and actionable diagnostics through clear interpretation of exit results.

## Implementation Details
- **Exit Code Definitions:** Define a set of constants for common exit conditions such as:
  - 0: Success
  - 1: General error
  - 2: Invalid argument or usage error
  - 3: Configuration error
  - 4: Diagnostic failure
  - 5: Signal interruption (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- **Integration with CLI:**
  - Update the main execution flow in `src/lib/main.js` to return appropriate exit codes based on the outcome of the command processing.
  - Enhance error handling to catch exceptions or invalid inputs and exit with the corresponding code.
  - Optionally provide a helper module (e.g. `src/lib/exitCodes.js`) that centralizes the exit code logic and documentation.
- **Signal Handling:** Integrate graceful shutdown behavior so that if the process receives termination signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM), it logs an informative message and exits with a distinct exit code (e.g., 5).

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests in the `tests/unit` folder to simulate error conditions and ensure that the correct exit codes are returned. Verify behavior for invalid arguments, configuration issues, and signal interrupts.
- **Edge Cases:** Include tests for unexpected exceptions to ensure they are caught and always result in a standardized exit code.

## Documentation
- **README and CONTRIBUTING Updates:** Update the documentation to explain the meaning of each exit code. Provide usage examples and instructions on how to interpret these codes during troubleshooting, CI/CD workflows, and automated monitoring.
- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Successful execution
  node src/lib/main.js
  echo $?  # Should output 0

  # Execution with an invalid argument
  node src/lib/main.js --invalid
  echo $?  # Should output 2
  ```

## Benefits
- **Consistency:** Provides a predictable way to handle exit statuses across various modules of the CLI application.
- **Diagnostics and Debugging:** Simplifies the identification of error sources in automated workflows, making it easier for developers and CI systems to diagnose failures.
- **User Guidance:** Clear exit codes serve as an additional form of documentation and help users quickly understand the outcome of their CLI commands.
