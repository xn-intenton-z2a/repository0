# Overview
This feature consolidates file handling operations and file watching capabilities into one unified module. FILE_MANAGER provides users with the ability to read, write, append, count, and search file contents, while also monitoring files or directories for changes. This consolidated approach reduces redundancy and streamlines file-based automation tasks, aligning with the repository’s goal of modular and self-contained CLI utilities.

# CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--file` that activates FILE_MANAGER.
- **Sub-Commands for File Operations:**
  - `read <filename>`: Outputs the content of the file.
  - `write <filename> <content>`: Writes (or overwrites) content to the file.
  - `append <filename> <content>`: Appends content to the file.
  - `count <filename>`: Displays counts of lines, words, and characters.
  - `search <filename> <pattern>`: Searches for a regex pattern and returns matching lines.
- **Sub-Commands for File Watching:**
  - `watch <path>`: Monitors a file or directory for changes.
  - `on-change <command>`: Specifies the CLI command(s) to execute when change is detected.
  - Optional flag `--debounce <milliseconds>`: Configures a debounce interval to reduce rapid re-triggering.

# Implementation Details
- **File Operations:** Leverage Node’s built-in `fs` module to perform asynchronous file I/O operations with appropriate error handling for missing files or permission issues.
- **File Watching:** Use `fs.watch` or `fs.watchFile` to detect file system changes. Upon detecting changes, execute the specified command(s) using child process invocation. Incorporate a debounce mechanism to aggregate rapid changes.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear, descriptive error messages and warnings when file operations or monitoring fail, ensuring the CLI remains resilient.
- **Integration:** The feature integrates into the global CLI, respecting global flags (e.g., JSON output mode) and consistent conventions with other modules.

# Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Include tests simulating file operations using temporary files, and file watching events with controlled changes to validate command triggering and debounce functionality.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and inline comments to describe the usage of the FILE_MANAGER including examples like:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --file read ./example.txt`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --file watch ./src --on-change "npm run build" --debounce 500`

# Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging file operations and monitoring in a single, cohesive module, FILE_MANAGER reinforces the repository’s mission of providing streamlined, self-contained CLI utilities that aid in development automation and enhance collaborative workflows.
