# METRICS

## Overview
This feature introduces a repository metrics module that provides key statistics about the projectâ€™s state. It aggregates information from Git history, test coverage summaries, and build performance to deliver actionable insights for developers and maintainers. The metrics can be displayed in a human-readable format or as structured JSON for integration with dashboards or CI/CD pipelines.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (`--metrics`) in the main entry file (`src/lib/main.js`).
  - Optionally support a `--json` flag to output the metrics in a structured JSON format.

- **Data Collection:**
  - Use Node.js built-in modules and Git commands (via `child_process`) to extract commit counts, recent commit timestamps, and other versioning data.
  - Parse available test coverage summary files (if available) or integrate with test results to compute a coverage percentage.
  - Optionally, include performance data (e.g., average build time) if such metrics are available from previous workflow runs.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - In default mode, display a well-structured summary report with sections for Git statistics, test coverage, and build performance.
  - In JSON mode, output a detailed object containing each metric, enabling integration with external tools.

- **Modular Design:**
  - Implement the metrics functionality in a single module (e.g., `src/lib/metrics.js`) to ensure maintainability and ease of testing.
  - Maintain robust error handling in cases where data sources (like coverage files or Git repositories) are missing or malformed.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to simulate different repository states and verify that all expected metrics are correctly parsed and reported.
  - Test both plain text and JSON outputs to ensure consistency with expected formats.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include usage examples:
  ```bash
  # Display repository metrics in plain text
  node src/lib/main.js --metrics

  # Display repository metrics in JSON format
  node src/lib/main.js --metrics --json
  ```

## Benefits
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides a quick overview of repository health, including commit activity, test coverage, and performance metrics.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Assists developers in tracking progress over time and identifying areas that may require attention.
- **Seamless Integration:** Outputs data in both human-readable and machine-readable formats, aligning well with CI/CD automation.
