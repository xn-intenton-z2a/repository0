# ARG_VALIDATION Feature Specification

This feature enhances the CLI tool by introducing robust argument parsing and validation. By integrating existing libraries like yargs and zod, the tool will provide clear error messages when an unknown or malformed command is used. This update ensures that only supported commands (e.g., help, diagnostics, version, update, export, import, chat) are processed, and adds graceful error handling with suggestions for proper usage.

## Overview

The ARG_VALIDATION feature upgrades the minimal CLI processing currently implemented in `src/lib/main.js`. Leveraging yargs for command-line argument parsing and zod for validation, the CLI will now:
- Parse command-line arguments into a structured format.
- Validate the input against a defined schema to ensure only supported commands and options are accepted.
- Provide an informative error message along with usage hints if the input is invalid or unsupported.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- Import and configure yargs to handle CLI argument parsing.
- Define a schema using zod to validate commands and options.
- Update the main function to dispatch supported commands, while displaying a clear error and guidance for unknown commands.
- Ensure that built-in commands (help, diagnostics, version, update, export, import, chat) remain supported.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- Add test cases to simulate invalid or unsupported CLI commands. For instance, verify that an unrecognized command returns a specific error message that suggests using the help command.
- Ensure tests still cover the default output for cases when no arguments or valid commands are provided.

### README File (README.md):
- Update the Usage section to reflect the improved command-line argument validation and error messaging.
- Document examples showing both valid commands and example error messages when an invalid command is provided.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- No new dependencies are required; the feature utilizes the already included yargs and zod libraries.

## Benefits

- **Improved Usability:** Users receive immediate feedback with guidance when entering unsupported commands.
- **Robustness:** Ensures that the CLI behaves predictably, only processing valid commands and options.
- **Consistency:** Aligns with the repository’s mission by enhancing the CLI’s reliability with minimal yet valuable code changes.
