# Overview
The AUDIT feature consolidates command history logging and usage analytics into a single, self-contained module. It provides a detailed audit trail for every executed command while offering aggregated performance metrics. This unified feature supports both retrospective analysis and real-time monitoring of the CLI tool's operations.

# CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new flag `--audit` to access audit functionality.
- **Sub-Commands/Options:**
  - **Default:** Shows a combined view of command history and aggregated metrics (such as total commands executed, per-command frequency, and execution durations).
  - **Export:** `--audit export [filename]` exports the complete audit trail in CSV format for further analysis.
  - **Clear:** `--audit clear` clears the audit log, resetting both history and associated metrics.

# Implementation Details
- **Logging and Data Collection:**
  - Capture each CLI command execution along with metadata (timestamp, tool version, execution duration, and input echo).
  - Store each entry persistently (e.g., in a log file) for a complete history record.
- **Aggregation and Metrics:**
  - Process log entries to calculate aggregated statistics, including total command count, per-command frequency, and performance metrics (average, min, and max execution times).
  - Present both a detailed history and summarized analytics within one unified view.
- **Export Functionality:**
  - Convert audit entries to CSV with well-defined columns (Command, Input, Timestamp, Version, Execution Duration, and Result/Error).
  - Support output to standard output or file writing based on an optional filename parameter.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear messages if the log is empty or if export operations encounter file access issues.

# Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Ensure that audit logging, aggregation, export, and clear functions are fully covered. Tests should simulate various CLI sessions and validate both history and metrics outputs.
- **Documentation:** Update the README, CLI usage guides, and inline source comments with examples of using the new `--audit` commands. Provide clear instructions for exporting and clearing the audit log.

# Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging previously separate HISTORY and METRICS features into the new AUDIT module, the repository further supports healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. The unified audit trail not only aids in troubleshooting and performance analysis but also provides transparency and accountability in CLI operationsâ€”all maintained as a self-contained utility.
