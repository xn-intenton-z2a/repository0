# AUDIT

## Overview
This feature introduces a persistent audit logging capability to the CLI tool. Every command invocation will be recorded into a local audit log file (e.g., `audit.log`), capturing metadata such as the command name, cleansed input parameters, timestamp, execution duration, and exit status. By providing a persistent record of all CLI interactions, this feature enables developers and users to track usage, diagnose issues, and review historical command activity in line with the repository’s mission of promoting transparency and healthy collaboration.

## CLI Integration
- **Global Flag (Optional):** An optional flag `--audit` can be provided to force an immediate write of the current command details into the audit log. Without the flag, every command execution records its log automatically.
- **Log Retrieval (Optional):** A new command `--history` may be introduced (if not already available via HTTP API) to print the contents of the audit log in a readable format.
- **Output Modes:** The audit log entries include both plain text and JSON metadata. In JSON output mode, each log entry is stored in a structured JSON object. The CLI remains unaffected by JSON flags; audit logging occurs independently in a local file.

## Implementation Details
- **Log File Management:** A single file (e.g., `audit.log`) will be used to append audit entries. The file is created lazily on the first log entry. Basic error handling ensures that if the log file is inaccessible, a warning is emitted without disrupting normal CLI operation.
- **Metadata Recorded:** Each log entry records:
  - Command name
  - Cleaned input parameters (post filtering global flags)
  - Timestamp of command execution
  - Execution duration in milliseconds
  - Output status (success or error)
- **Integration with Existing Code:** The audit logging routine can be integrated at the end of the main command processing function. This is achieved with minimal additions to the single source file while keeping the modular design intact.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Tests will simulate various commands and verify that corresponding audit entries are appended to the `audit.log` file with all required metadata. Edge cases, such as failure to access the log file, will also be tested.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated to mention the audit feature. Inline code comments will explain the log appending mechanism, and a sample log format will be provided.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The AUDIT feature supports the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration by enhancing transparency in command usage. Persistent logging of CLI operations facilitates troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and usage reviews, thereby contributing to streamlined automation and collective code accountability.
