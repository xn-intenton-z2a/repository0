# TEMPLATE_VALIDATOR

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight validation tool that ensures the repository adheres to the template standards expected from a well-formed repository0. The validator checks for the presence and basic integrity of key files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, MISSION.md, LICENSE, etc.) and confirms that they meet minimal formatting and content guidelines. This supports healthy collaboration and onboarding, helping contributors quickly verify that the repository structure is complete and aligned with the mission.

## Implementation Details
- **File Existence and Integrity Checks:**
  - Use Node.js built-in modules (fs and path) to verify that critical files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, MISSION.md, package.json, etc.) exist in the repository root.
  - Optionally check for minimal content criteria (e.g., that README.md starts with an introductory section and includes links to MISSION.md and CONTRIBUTING.md).
  - Validate that essential fields (like version and description in package.json) are correctly populated.
  - Provide clear logging output that indicates which files passed or failed validation.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--validate-template`) to run the repository validation as an independent action.
  - Ensure the tool gracefully exits with a success or error code, depending on validation results.

- **Modularity:**
  - Implement the entire template validation logic in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/templateValidator.js`) to ensure ease of maintenance and alignment with the projectâ€™s minimal and modular design philosophy.
  - Integrate robust error handling and minimal external dependencies to maintain performance and reliability.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to simulate different repository states (missing files, incorrectly formatted files, etc.) using mocks or temporary file structures.
  - Verify that the validator accurately reports both successful and failed validations with clear messages.
  - Test CLI integration to ensure the `--validate-template` flag triggers the validation logic properly.

## Documentation
- **Usage Instructions:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to include a section on using the template validator.
  - Provide examples of how to run the validation tool via the CLI:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --validate-template
    ```
  - Document expected outputs and troubleshooting steps when validation fails.

## Benefits
- **Ensure Template Integrity:** Provides a quick means for contributors and automated workflows to verify that the repository structure adheres to the preset template standards.
- **Improve Onboarding:** New contributors receive immediate feedback that key documentation and configuration files are present and correct.
- **Automated Quality Checks:** Can be integrated into CI pipelines to prevent merging of incomplete or misconfigured repositories.
