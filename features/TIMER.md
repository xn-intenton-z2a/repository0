# TIMER with NOTIFICATION

## Overview
This update enhances the existing TIMER feature by adding an optional notification mechanism. In addition to its primary function of executing a countdown timer, the timer now supports a new flag `--notify` which, when enabled, triggers a desktop notification (or audible alert) to inform the user when the countdown has completed. This improvement is designed to help users engage in multitasking workflows where they can be alerted upon timer completion without needing to continuously monitor the CLI.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Addition:** The `--timer` CLI flag remains available as before. Now, users can append an optional `--notify` flag to their command:
  - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --timer 10 --notify`
- **Notification Flag:** The `--notify` flag is optional and can be combined with existing modes (plain text or JSON output). When enabled, the system will attempt to trigger a desktop notification as well as the usual CLI output.

## Timer Logic & Notification Integration
- **Timer Countdown:** The timer accepts a single numeric argument representing the duration in seconds. The countdown function will wait for the specified duration before completing.
- **Notification Mechanism:** Upon completion, if the `--notify` flag is set, the following actions are performed:
  - **Desktop Notification:** The CLI will invoke a notification function that leverages system capabilities (or an optional library such as `node-notifier` if available) to display a system-level message (e.g., using native OS notifications or a beep sound).
  - **Fallback:** In environments where desktop notifications are unsupported, the CLI will display an additional alert message in the console (e.g., prepending the message with a sound emoji or text indicating an alert).
- **Output Modes:** In non-JSON mode, the notification is shown as a native desktop alert (if possible) and a console message saying "Timer finished!". In JSON mode, the response will include an extra field, e.g., "notified": true, to indicate that a notification was dispatched.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:** As before, the command validates that the provided duration is a positive numeric value. If the input is missing or invalid, the command returns a standardized error: "Error: Invalid timer duration provided.".
- **Notification Errors:** If the notification mechanism fails (e.g., due to missing system support or library issues), the error is caught and a warning message is appended to the output without impacting the timer’s core functionality.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests should simulate timer completion with and without the `--notify` flag, verifying that:
  - The timer completes as expected.
  - In notification mode, a notification is triggered or an appropriate fallback message is displayed.
  - Both plain text and JSON outputs include the intended notification indicator.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage docs to include new examples:
  - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --timer 10 --notify` (non-JSON output)
  - Example with JSON: `node src/lib/main.js --json --timer 10 --notify`
  - Inline comments in `src/lib/main.js` should detail the new notification logic and any platform-specific considerations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
Integrating desktop notifications enhances user experience by reducing the need for constant manual monitoring, thus promoting proactive workflow management. This update aligns with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation by enhancing the modular, single-source CLI utility with practical usability improvements.
