# ERROR_HELP & COLOR

## Overview
This update enhances the existing ERROR_HELP feature by integrating dynamic, context-aware troubleshooting along with optional color-coded output formatting in non-JSON mode. By leveraging ANSI escape codes, the CLI tool will display error messages in red, warnings in yellow, and successes in green. An optional `--color` flag (or automatic TTY detection) will trigger the display of colored text to improve readability and foster healthy collaboration.

## Implementation Details
- **Color Output Integration:**
  - Update the global output functions (`sendSuccess` and `sendError`) to optionally wrap text with ANSI escape codes based on a new `--color` flag or TTY detection.
  - In plain text mode (non-JSON), error messages will appear in red (e.g., using `\u001b[31m` for red and `\u001b[0m` for resetting), warnings in yellow, and success messages in green.
  - The color formatting will be conditional so that when JSON mode is active, the output remains unmodified.

- **Context-Aware Help:**
  - Continue to provide detailed troubleshooting suggestions alongside standard error messages. The additional color cues will enhance the guidance by clearly distinguishing error levels.
  - Ensure that inline documentation and help links remain visible through color contrasts.

- **Flag and Configuration:**
  - Introduce a new optional CLI flag `--color` to explicitly enable colorized output. In the absence of this flag, the system may auto-detect TTY support to decide if colors should be applied.
  - Document the feature in the README and update the CLI usage documentation with examples:
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --color --sum 3 5` to see a green success message or red error messages when applicable.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Add tests to verify that in non-JSON mode with the `--color` flag, the output strings include the appropriate ANSI escape codes for errors, warnings, and success messages.
  - Ensure that when JSON mode is enabled (with `--json` or `--json-pretty`), the output remains plain without embedded ANSI codes.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and error-handling sections with usage examples of colored output.
  - Inline comments in the source file should document the new conditional logic for color formatting and the handling of the `--color` flag.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
This update reinforces our mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined automation by reducing user friction during error scenarios. Color-coded messages not only enhance the aesthetic of the CLI but also provide immediate visual cues to help diagnose and resolve issues quickly.
