# ERROR_HELP Feature

## Overview
This feature enhances the error messaging system by integrating context-aware help and troubleshooting suggestions into the CLI tool. When a command fails due to invalid input or misconfiguration (for example, when encountering disallowed tokens such as variations of 'NaN'), the tool will provide actionable recommendations to guide users toward resolving common issues. This feature underlines our commitment to healthy collaboration by reducing user confusion and improving overall usability.

## Implementation Details
- **Error Interception:**
  - Modify the global error handling functions (e.g., `sendError`) to check for specific error messages or codes.
  - Based on the type of error, append detailed troubleshooting suggestions. For example, if the error is "Error: No valid numeric inputs provided.", include a note to verify inputs and check the `INVALID_TOKENS` environment variable configuration.

- **Context-Aware Suggestions:**
  - Maintain a mapping of common error messages to suggested remedies. The mapping can include checks for:
    - Invalid numeric inputs
    - Use of disallowed tokens (with emphasis on how to override via `INVALID_TOKENS`)
    - Incorrect usage of CLI flags
  - Ensure that suggestions are concise and utilize inline documentation links (e.g., linking to the README or CONTRIBUTING guidelines) for more detailed help.

- **Integration Points:**
  - Update helper functions such as `generateWarning` and modify `sendError` to optionally include a `help` field in JSON responses, as well as appending advisory text in plain text mode.
  - This modification should be backward-compatible with the existing JSON output mode, ensuring that additional metadata fields are added without altering the current response structure.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests to simulate error conditions and verify that additional suggestion messages are included in both plain text and JSON responses.
  - Test various error scenarios (e.g., invalid number formats, disallowed tokens, division by zero) and ensure the output contains contextual help.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and error-handling sections in the documentation to describe how the ERROR_HELP feature assists in troubleshooting.
  - Include examples demonstrating error outputs with suggestions (e.g., "If you encounter this error, consider checking your input tokens and environment settings.").

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The ERROR_HELP feature directly supports our mission of fostering healthy collaboration by reducing user friction. It ensures that users receive not only an error message, but also practical advice to remedy issues, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and operational transparency of the CLI tool.
