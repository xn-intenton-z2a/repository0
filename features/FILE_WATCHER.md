# FILE_WATCHER

## Overview
This feature adds a file monitoring utility to the CLI tool. FILE_WATCHER enables users to watch specific files or directories for changes and automatically trigger configured commands when modifications occur. This addition streamlines workflow automation, allowing developers to quickly react to file updates (such as source code changes, new log entries, or configuration updates) without manually polling.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** A new global flag `--watch` activates the file watching mode.
- **Sub-Commands and Options:**
  - `--watch <path>`: Specify a file or directory to monitor.
  - `--on-change <command>`: Define a CLI command to run when a change is detected. Multiple commands can be configured, which will be executed sequentially.
  - Optional flags for debounce settings (e.g., `--debounce <milliseconds>`) to prevent rapid re-triggering when many changes happen in quick succession.
  
## Implementation Details
- **File System Monitoring:**
  - Use Node's built-in `fs.watch` or `fs.watchFile` to monitor specified paths.
  - Validate that the provided path exists and is accessible. Display user-friendly error messages if the path is invalid.

- **Command Execution:**
  - When a file change is detected, the specified command(s) are executed via child process invocation. Output of triggered commands will adhere to the global JSON output mode if enabled.
  - Implement a debounce mechanism to avoid flooding the system with events during rapid file modifications.

- **Error Handling & Logging:**
  - Provide clear diagnostics if watching fails due to permissions or invalid paths.
  - Log file change events with timestamps for audit purposes.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Write tests simulating file changes using temporary files/directories to ensure watchers trigger the configured commands correctly.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CLI usage guides to include examples, such as:
    - `node src/lib/main.js --watch ./src --on-change "npm run build" --debounce 500`
  - Include inline comments in the source file explaining the monitoring logic and command triggering flow.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
FILE_WATCHER reinforces the repositoryâ€™s commitment to modular, self-contained CLI utilities that streamline automation. By providing file monitoring capabilities, it enables rapid feedback loops and facilitates healthy collaboration in development workflows.
