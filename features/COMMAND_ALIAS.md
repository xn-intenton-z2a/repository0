# COMMAND_ALIAS

## Overview
This feature introduces a customizable command aliasing system for the CLI application in repository0. Users can define shortcuts or alternative names for frequently used commands and flags. This improves usability especially for power users and contributors who often invoke long command sequences. The feature aligns with the repository's mission by fostering ease-of-use and promoting healthy collaboration via simplified command execution.

## Implementation Details
- **Alias Definition:** Create a dedicated JSON configuration (e.g., `aliases.json`) at the repository root where users can define key-value pairs mapping alias names to full command sequences.
- **Integration with CLI:** Enhance the argument parser in `src/lib/argParser.js` (or directly in `src/lib/main.js` if preferred) to load and process the alias file. When command-line arguments are received, the parser will check if any argument matches a defined alias and substitute it with the expanded command sequence.
- **Fallback and Error Handling:** If an alias is not recognized, the CLI should fall back to standard parsing and provide a clear error message if the alias definition is malformed. Additionally, if the alias configuration file is missing or empty, the system should continue execution without interruption.
- **Modularity:** The aliasing logic should reside in a self-contained module (e.g., `src/lib/commandAlias.js`) to simplify maintenance and testing.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Develop test cases in `tests/unit/commandAlias.test.js` to ensure that alias definitions are correctly loaded and substituted. Tests should cover valid substitutions, missing alias file scenarios, and malformed alias configurations.
- **Edge Cases:** Verify that recursive aliases or conflicting alias definitions are handled gracefully, either via clear error messages or documented warnings.

## Documentation
- **User Guide:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to include a section on using command aliases. Explain how to create or modify the `aliases.json` file and provide examples.
- **Usage Examples:** Provide CLI examples such as:
  ```bash
  # Assuming an alias 'ls' for '--list-all'
  node src/lib/main.js ls
  ```
- **Maintenance Guidelines:** Document how to extend or modify the aliasing module to support future enhancements or additional alias formats.
