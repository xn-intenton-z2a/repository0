# SHELL_COMPLETION

## Overview
Introduce shell auto-completion support for the CLI tool. This feature automatically generates completion scripts for popular shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh, and Fish) based on the current command mapping. It enhances usability by allowing users to quickly discover and complete available commands, flags, and aliases.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Add a new global flag `--completion`.
- **Shell Detection:** When the flag is used, the CLI will detect the user's shell environment (or accept an optional parameter like `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`) and output the appropriate auto-completion script.
- **Script Generation:** The completion script is generated dynamically by scanning the internal command mapping within `src/lib/main.js`, including all aliases. The script provides completion for both global flags (e.g., `--json`, `--help`) and command-specific flags.
- **Usage Examples:**
  - Bash: `node src/lib/main.js --completion bash > repository0_completion.sh`
  - Zsh: `node src/lib/main.js --completion zsh > _repository0`
  - Fish: `node src/lib/main.js --completion fish > repository0.fish`

## Implementation Details
- **Script Templates:** Maintain simple template files for each supported shell which can be dynamically populated with the list of commands and flags.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Since the CLI command mapping is maintained in a single source file, the completion script generation can extract the latest command details without manual updates.
- **Error Handling:** If an unsupported shell is detected or the user does not provide a valid shell parameter, output a clear error message along with usage instructions.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to verify that the correct completion script is generated for each supported shell. Test error paths for invalid or missing shell identifiers.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guide with examples demonstrating how to integrate the completion scripts into the user's shell configuration.
- **Inline Comments:** Clearly document the logic for detecting shells and populating script templates in the source file.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
Enhancing the CLI tool with shell auto-completion directly supports the mission of fostering healthy collaboration and practical automation. It streamlines user interaction with the CLI, reducing friction and improving productivity. This modular, single-source file update further demonstrates the repository's commitment to user-friendly, automated workflows.
