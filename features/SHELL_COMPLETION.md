# SHELL_COMPLETION

## Overview
This feature introduces shell completion support for the CLI tool. Users will be able to generate auto-completion scripts for popular shells (e.g. Bash, Zsh, and Fish) through a dedicated CLI flag. The addition of this feature improves usability and streamlines command discovery, aligning with the repository's mission of promoting healthy collaboration and efficient workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Flag Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--completion`) that, when invoked, allows users to specify a target shell (e.g. `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`).
  - Based on the provided shell type, generate and output the appropriate auto-completion script.

- **Script Generation:**
  - Implement the shell completion logic in a single, self-contained source file (e.g. `src/lib/shellCompletion.js`).
  - Use built-in Node.js APIs and minimal dependencies to output the script content for the target shell.
  - Ensure the generated script adheres to the syntax rules of the respective shell and can be easily sourced or installed.

- **Integration & Modularity:**
  - Ensure that the new feature is integrated into the main CLI (in `src/lib/main.js`) without interfering with existing functionalities.
  - Maintain backward compatibility so that users not requiring auto-completion are unaffected.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g. in `tests/unit/shellCompletion.test.js`) to verify that the correct completion scripts are generated for each supported shell.
  - Ensure that invalid or unsupported shell types result in a clear error message.

## Documentation
- **Usage Examples:**
  ```bash
  # Generate Bash auto-completion script
  node src/lib/main.js --completion bash

  # Generate Zsh auto-completion script
  node src/lib/main.js --completion zsh

  # Generate Fish auto-completion script
  node src/lib/main.js --completion fish
  ```
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files to detail how to install and use the generated completion scripts.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Facilitates rapid command discovery and reduces the learning curve for new users.
- **Streamlined Workflows:** Supports more efficient CLI usage which is especially beneficial in CI/CD and automated development environments.
- **Simplicity and Modularity:** Implements auto-completion in a self-contained module, keeping the main codebase clean and maintainable.
