# ARG_VALIDATION Feature Specification

This feature refines the CLI argument parsing and validation by integrating robust libraries (yargs and zod) to ensure that only supported commands are processed and that any invalid or malformed input is clearly reported to the user.

## Overview

The updated ARG_VALIDATION feature will improve the CLI tool by:
- Replacing the basic argument handling with a structured parser using yargs.
- Defining and enforcing a validation schema with zod to allow only known commands and options.
- Providing descriptive error messages and usage hints when invalid input is detected.
- Maintaining support for all existing commands including `greet`, and preparing the CLI for future commands like `help`, `chat`, `export`, `import`, `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update` as documented in other feature specs.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Integrate yargs**: Replace the current if-else branch with a yargs-based parser to handle CLI arguments in a structured manner.
- **Define a Zod Schema**: Use zod to define a schema that strictly allows commands such as `greet`, `help`, `chat`, `export`, `import`, `diagnostics`, `version`, and `update`.
- **Error Handling**: If the input does not match the schema, display a clear error message with guidance on proper usage.
- **Command Routing**: Maintain the current functionality for `greet` while setting up the framework for additional commands in the future.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **Existing Tests Update**: Update tests to account for the new argument parsing and validation behavior.
- **New Test Cases**: Add tests to simulate invalid input, ensuring that errors are properly thrown and that the user is provided with usage hints.

### README File (README.md):
- **Usage Section Update**: Document the improved argument parsing and provide examples of both valid commands (e.g., `greet`, `help`) and error cases when an unknown command is used.
- **Error Messaging**: Explain that in the event of invalid commands, the user will receive a descriptive error message advising on available commands.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No New Dependencies**: The feature uses the already included libraries (yargs and zod) to implement validation.

## Benefits

- **Improved Usability**: Users will receive immediate and clear feedback if they enter an unsupported command or malformed arguments, reducing user error.
- **Enhanced Robustness**: The CLI will process only valid input, which enhances stability and reduces unexpected behavior.
- **Extensibility**: This update provides the groundwork for future commands and features, making the CLI easier to extend and maintain.

This refined ARG_VALIDATION feature aligns with the repository's mission of providing handy CLI utilities in Node.js, ensuring that even as new commands are added, the CLI maintains a high standard of input validation and user guidance.
