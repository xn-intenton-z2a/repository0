# SELF_UPDATE

## Overview
This feature introduces self-update functionality to the repository0 CLI tool. When invoked with the new flag `--self-update`, the tool checks for a newer version available on the npm registry and performs an update if confirmed by the user. This feature ensures users always run the latest version with bug fixes, performance improvements, and new capabilities.

## CLI Integration
- **Flag Addition:** Introduce a new global CLI flag `--self-update`.
- **Behavior:** When the flag is provided, the CLI will connect to the npm registry (or a defined update endpoint) to retrieve the latest version information for `@xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`.
- **User Interaction:** After fetching the version details, the tool informs the user of the current and latest version. It then either automatically update (if a `--force` flag is provided) or ask for confirmation before proceeding with self-update.

## Implementation Details
- **Version Check:** Use Node's `child_process.exec` or a lightweight HTTP request to query the npm registry for the latest version.
- **Update Mechanism:** If an update is available, execute a system command (e.g., `npm install -g @xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`) to perform the update. This command can run asynchronously and report progress.
- **Feedback & Logging:** The self-update process outputs status messages in both plain text and JSON modes. Metadata such as current version, new version, and update duration is included in the response.

## Error Handling & Testing
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages if the update check fails due to network issues or permission errors while attempting to update. If the CLI does not have sufficient privileges, notify the user with steps to update manually.
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate a successful version check and update, as well as error scenarios. Integration tests should verify the update command is executed correctly in a dry-run mode to avoid unintended changes.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SELF_UPDATE feature reinforces the mission of repository0 by enhancing the maintainability and reliability of the CLI tool. By allowing users to easily keep their tool up-to-date, it promotes healthy collaboration and ensures that everyone benefits from the latest automated improvements without manual intervention.
