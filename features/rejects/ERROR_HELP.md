# ERROR_HELP & COLOR + I18N

## Overview
The updated ERROR_HELP feature not only provides dynamic, context-aware troubleshooting and color-coded output for improved readability, but it now also integrates internationalization (I18N) support. This enhancement enables error, warning, and help messages to be displayed in multiple languages based on user preference, further reducing friction and promoting healthy collaboration across diverse user bases.

## Internationalization Support
- **Language Configuration:** Users can now specify their preferred language for CLI output via an environment variable (e.g., `CLI_LANGUAGE`). Supported languages include English (`en`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), and additional languages can be added via configuration.
- **Localized Messages:** Error messages, warnings, and troubleshooting hints are mapped via a lightweight dictionary in the source code. If a translation for a specific message is unavailable in the selected language, the system gracefully falls back to English.
- **CLI Flag Integration:** In non-JSON mode, localized messages still appear with ANSI color coding (red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for successes). In JSON mode, the output remains plain but includes a field noting the active language.

## Implementation Details
- **Environment Variable:** The new variable `CLI_LANGUAGE` determines the language of output messages. Default value is `en` if the variable is unset or the specified language is unsupported.
- **Dictionary Mapping:** A simple mapping object pairs message keys with translations for each supported language. For example:
  - `ERROR_NO_INPUT`: { en: "Error: No valid numeric inputs provided.", es: "Error: No se proporcionaron entradas numéricas válidas.", fr: "Erreur : Aucune entrée numérique valide fournie." }
- **Integration with Existing Logic:** The helper functions `sendError` and `sendSuccess` are updated to select the appropriate localized message based on the current setting. The existing warning aggregation and ANSI formatting remain unchanged.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Unit tests should verify that messages appear in the selected language. Documentation is updated (README and CONTRIBUTING) to instruct users on setting `CLI_LANGUAGE` and adding new translations.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By adding internationalization support to ERROR_HELP, the repository further embraces its mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation. Users from diverse linguistic backgrounds can now interact with the CLI tool in their native language, lowering barriers and enhancing accessibility.
