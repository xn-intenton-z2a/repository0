# INTERACTIVE & TUTORIAL

## Overview
In addition to the existing interactive REPL and batch processing modes, this update integrates a new **tutorial sub-mode** within the INTERACTIVE feature. The tutorial mode provides a guided, step-by-step walkthrough of the CLI tool’s functionality, offering new users an engaging introduction and practical examples of available commands. This extension streamlines onboarding and empowers users to learn the tool’s capabilities quickly, in line with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration.

## CLI Integration
- **Invocation:** The tutorial mode can be activated by adding a new sub-command (e.g., `tutorial`) to the interactive flag. For example:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --interactive tutorial`
- **Mode Selection:** When the `tutorial` sub-mode is detected, the CLI will present a series of guided screens with instructions, example commands, and tips on using various sub-commands (such as arithmetic operations, configuration, and security utilities).
- **Fallback Behavior:** If users input an unknown command within the interactive session, the tutorial mode can offer contextual help and suggest usage examples.

## Implementation Details
- **Guided Walkthrough:** The tutorial will run in a text-based format, displaying instructions sequentially. It may include prompts for user input to simulate command execution and provide immediate feedback.
- **Incremental Learning:** The tutorial is structured in sections, each focusing on a set of related commands (e.g., basic math commands, configuration management, and advanced utilities) with a brief description, example commands, and expected output.
- **Integration with REPL:** Users can switch between the guided tutorial and regular REPL mode or exit the tutorial to return to standard interactive sessions.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Robust parsing of sub-commands ensures that users invoking the tutorial mode receive the proper instructional content.
- Any invalid or unsupported inputs during the tutorial sequence trigger informative error messages, directing users back to the main tutorial navigation.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate tutorial mode interactions, verifying that each tutorial screen displays the correct information and that navigation commands work as expected.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated to include examples of launching the tutorial. Inline comments in the source code explain the instructional logic and navigation flow.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By embedding an interactive tutorial within the existing INTERACTIVE feature, this update enhances user onboarding and helps maintain streamlined automation workflows. It fosters healthy collaboration by reducing the learning curve for new users and ensuring that the tool's powerful functionalities are accessible and well-documented.
