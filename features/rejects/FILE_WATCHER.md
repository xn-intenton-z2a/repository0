# FILE_WATCHER

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight file watcher for developers working on repository0. By adding a new CLI flag (`--watch-files`), the repository will monitor key directories (such as `src/` and `tests/`) for changes. When changes are detected, the watcher can automatically trigger actions like re-running tests or notifying the user, thereby improving the development feedback loop and supporting continuous integration and development practices.

## Implementation Details
- **File Monitoring:** Leverage Node.js's built-in `fs.watch` API to monitor changes in designated directories (e.g., `src/` and `tests/`).
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI flag (`--watch-files`) in the main execution file (`src/lib/main.js`). When this flag is provided, the application should initialize the file watcher after processing other CLI arguments.
- **Event Handling:** On file modification, the system should either trigger an automated test run (by invoking a child process that runs tests) or log a message to notify developers. Ensure that the watcher handles common edge cases (e.g., temporary file changes, rapid changes) gracefully.
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate the file watching logic in a single module (e.g., `src/lib/fileWatcher.js`) to keep it self-contained and maintainable.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Implement tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/fileWatcher.test.js`) to simulate file changes and verify that the appropriate events are emitted and handled.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure that the watcher does not consume excessive resources and handles cases such as file deletion or rapid successive changes without crashing.

## Documentation
- Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include a section on the file watcher feature. Provide usage examples, such as:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --watch-files
  ```
- Document how the file watcher works, what directories are monitored by default, and how users can configure or extend the functionality if needed.

This feature supports the repositoryâ€™s mission by fostering an efficient development environment and facilitating automated feedback, which is essential for maintaining robust CI/CD workflows.
