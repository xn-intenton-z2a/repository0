# CHAT_CLEAR Feature

This feature extends the existing chat functionality by adding a new subcommand, `clear`, which allows users to delete the existing chat history file (`.chat_history.json`). This update is aimed at enhancing usability by providing an easy mechanism to reset or clear the stored conversation history.

## Changes in Source File (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a condition to check if the first argument is `chat` and the second argument is `clear`.
- If the `clear` command is detected, the code should attempt to delete the `.chat_history.json` file if it exists.
- Provide appropriate console feedback to the user indicating success or failure (e.g., "Chat history cleared." or an error message if deletion fails).

## Changes in Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add unit tests to ensure that when the `clear` subcommand is executed:
  - The `.chat_history.json` file is removed if it exists.
  - The output message confirms the clearance of the chat history.
  - Edge cases (e.g., trying to clear when no history file exists) are properly handled.

## Changes in README.md
- Update the Chat Command section to document the new `clear` option. For example:
  ```
  node src/lib/main.js chat clear
  ```
  This command will remove the current chat history.

## Rationale
- Provides users with better control over their conversation history.
- Maintains consistency with the repository's mission to offer handy CLI utilities in Node.js with simple file-based persistence.
- Enhances the overall usability of the chat feature without introducing complexity or new files.

## Implementation Considerations
- The deletion of the chat history file should handle potential errors, such as file not existing, with graceful error handling and user notification.
- Ensure tests are idempotent and do not interfere with other tests or operations.
