# SECRETS_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature introduces a secure secrets management utility to the CLI tool. It allows users to add, retrieve, list, and remove sensitive information (such as API keys or passwords) that are stored in an encrypted local file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json). The SECRETS_MANAGER is designed to complement the CONFIG_MANAGER and SECURITY_UTILS features by providing a dedicated mechanism for safe storage, retrieval, and deletion of secrets, thereby reinforcing the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration through secure and modular utility tools.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flag:** Introduce a new global flag `--secrets` that activates the secrets management module.
- **Sub-Commands:** The following sub-commands should be supported:
  - **add <key> <secret>:** Encrypts and stores the given secret under the provided key.
  - **get <key>:** Retrieves and decrypts the secret corresponding to the key.
  - **list:** Displays a list of stored keys (without revealing the secrets).
  - **remove <key>:** Deletes the stored secret for the specified key.
- The module should prompt for a master password on first use or allow it to be provided through an environment variable (e.g., SECRETS_MASTER) to initialize the encryption mechanism.

## Implementation Details
- **Encryption:** Utilize Node's `crypto` module to perform symmetric encryption and decryption. The master password (or a derived key) is used for encrypting the secrets before storing them in the JSON file.
- **Data File:** The secrets are persisted in a file (e.g., .repository_secrets.json) stored locally. All data written to the file must be encrypted.
- **Operational Flow:**
  - When adding a secret, the module encrypts the secret and saves it under the provided key.
  - When retrieving, the module decrypts the value using the master password.
  - Listing secrets shows only the keys, ensuring sensitive data is not accidentally exposed.
  - Removing a secret deletes the entry from the file.

## Error Handling & Validation
- Validate that the master password is provided or prompt the user accordingly.
- Check for duplicate keys when adding a new secret and warn the user if a key already exists.
- Provide clear error messages for incorrect decryption (e.g., when an incorrect master password is provided), missing keys, or file I/O issues.
- Ensure that sensitive error details are not exposed in logs.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to cover each sub-command (add, get, list, remove) ensuring correct encryption, decryption, and error handling. Tests should simulate scenarios including invalid master passwords and handling of non-existent keys.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CLI usage guides with examples:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets add API_KEY mySecretValue`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets get API_KEY`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets list`
  - `node src/lib/main.js --secrets remove API_KEY`
- Provide inline comments in the source code to explain encryption logic and error management.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
The SECRETS_MANAGER feature reinforces the repository’s mission by adding secure, modular functionality for handling sensitive configurations. This tool supports healthy collaboration and automation by enabling users to safely manage secrets within a single, self-contained CLI repository.
