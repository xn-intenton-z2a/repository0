# EXTENSIONS

## Overview
This feature consolidates two auxiliary CLI enhancements into one unified extension module. It merges dynamic plugin loading (formerly provided by the PLUGIN_SYSTEM feature) with shell auto-completion support (formerly provided by the SHELL_COMPLETION feature). This integrated approach not only reduces redundancy by fitting within the 15-feature limit but also enriches the CLI tool by offering customizable functionality extensions and improved user experience through command auto-completion.

## Plugin Integration
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:**
  - The CLI checks for a `plugins/` directory at startup and dynamically imports any `.js` files found there.
  - Each plugin must export a command identifier and a handler function, which are then seamlessly integrated into the CLI command mapping.
  - Loading errors or improperly structured plugins generate warnings without stopping execution.

## Shell Auto-Completion
- **Auto-Generation of Completion Scripts:**
  - A new global flag (e.g., `--completion`) lets users generate auto-completion scripts for popular shells such as Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
  - The CLI dynamically reads its internal command mapping, including all aliases, to produce a tailored completion script based on the user’s shell type.
  - Clear error messages are issued if an unsupported shell is detected or if the user does not provide a valid shell parameter.

## Integration and Benefits
- Consolidates two related extensions into one module to streamline the project and stay under the maximum feature limit.
- Enhances overall CLI usability by enabling both custom plugin support and shell auto-completion, reducing setup overhead for end users.
- Supports healthy collaboration through extensibility and improved productivity, in line with the repository’s mission.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** New tests will simulate plugin loading from a temporary directory and validate correct generation of shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
- **Documentation:** The README and CLI usage guides will be updated with examples:
  - Plugin example: Place JavaScript modules in the `plugins/` directory to add custom commands.
  - Completion example: `node src/lib/main.js --completion bash > repository_completion.sh`

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By merging dynamic plugin integration and shell auto-completion into a single EXTENSIONS module, this feature reinforces our commitment to modular, self-contained, and user-friendly CLI utilities. This consolidation supports streamlined automation and healthy collaboration while keeping the repository's feature set within ideal limits.
