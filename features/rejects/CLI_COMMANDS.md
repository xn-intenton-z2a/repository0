# CLI_COMMANDS Feature Update

This update enhances the CLI tool by fully implementing the command routing for the "version" and "update" commands as documented in the existing CLI_COMMANDS feature specification. This update ensures that when a user invokes the CLI with these commands, they receive clear and appropriate responses.

## Overview

The CLI tool currently supports a few commands (greet, gcd, lcm, prime, diagnostics) while unknown commands result in an error message. This feature extends the command routing logic by adding support for:

- **version**: Outputs a message with the current repository version (e.g., "Version: 1.4.1-13").
- **update**: Simulates an update check by printing a message such as "Checking for updates... No updates available".

By adding these commands, the CLI becomes consistent with the documentation and package.json scripts, thereby enhancing the user experience and aligning with the repository's mission to provide handy Node.js CLI utilities.

## Implementation Details

### Source File (src/lib/main.js):
- **Command Detection:** Extend the existing command routing logic in the main function to detect the "version" and "update" commands.
- **Version Command:** When the first argument is "version", output the version string. Example:
  ```js
  if (command === "version") {
    console.log("Version: 1.4.1-13");
  }
  ```
- **Update Command:** When the first argument is "update", output a simulated update check message. Example:
  ```js
  else if (command === "update") {
    console.log("Checking for updates... No updates available");
  }
  ```
- Ensure that these new branches integrate seamlessly with the existing routing and error handling logic.

### Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Cases:** Add tests to simulate invoking the CLI with the "version" and "update" commands. Verify that the correct messages are printed.
- Example test case for version:
  ```js
  test("should output correct version", () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation(() => {});
    main(["version"]);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Version: 1.4.1-13");
    spy.mockRestore();
  });
  ```
- Example test case for update:
  ```js
  test("should output update message", () => {
    const spy = vi.spyOn(console, "log").mockImplementation(() => {});
    main(["update"]);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Checking for updates... No updates available");
    spy.mockRestore();
  });
  ```

### README File (README.md):
- **Documentation Update:** Add examples in the CLI usage section to demonstrate invoking the "version" and "update" commands.
- Ensure the README reflects that these commands are now supported and explain their outputs.

### Dependencies File (package.json):
- **No Additional Dependencies:** The feature uses existing dependencies. Confirm that the scripts for "version" and "check-update" in package.json remain consistent with the new command implementations.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Functionality:** Users receive immediate, clear output for version and update checks, providing a more complete CLI experience.
- **Improved Consistency:** Aligns the behavior of the CLI tool with the documented features and package.json scripts.
- **User Confidence:** Clear command responses help users understand the state of the application, contributing to a better overall user experience.
