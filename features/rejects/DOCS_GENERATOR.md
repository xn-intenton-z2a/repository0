# DOCS_GENERATOR

## Overview
This feature introduces an automated documentation generator that aggregates and compiles the various markdown documentation files present in the repository (including feature specifications, README, CONTRIBUTING, MISSION, and others) into a single unified document. The generated documentation will provide a comprehensive, navigable index of all repository components, making it easier for contributors and users to obtain an overview and locate specific information.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Introduce a new CLI flag (e.g. `--generate-docs`) that triggers the documentation generation process from the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`).
  - Upon invocation, the module scans the designated documentation directories (such as the `/features` folder, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and MISSION.md) and aggregates their content.

- **Aggregation Process:**
  - Read markdown files using Node.js built-in file system methods (`fs`, `path`), and merge them in a defined order (e.g., starting with MISSION, then CONTRIBUTING, followed by feature-specific files).
  - Generate an index with anchors linking directly to their corresponding sections. Each feature file’s title (extracted from its first level heading) will be used in the table of contents.
  - Optionally format the aggregated document with consistent markdown styling, using minimal dependencies to ensure maintainability.

- **Output Options:**
  - By default, output the aggregated documentation to a new file (e.g. `DOCUMENTATION.md`) in the repository root.
  - Support an optional `--stdout` flag to print the generated documentation directly to the console (in case of automated pipelines).

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/docsGenerator.test.js`) to simulate scanning directories and verify that the combined output includes all required sections.
  - Test file ordering, correct insertion of table of contents links, and edge cases such as missing documentation files.

## Documentation & Benefits
- **Usage Documentation:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage instructions for the `--generate-docs` flag.
  - Provide examples on how to invoke the documentation generator for both file output and STDOUT display.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Centralization:** Provides a single point of reference for repository documentation, reducing fragmentation across multiple files.
  - **Ease of Navigation:** A comprehensive table of contents makes it simple for users and contributors to locate specific information.
  - **Maintainability:** Automates the process of keeping documentation up-to-date, supporting the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and streamlined CI/CD workflows.
