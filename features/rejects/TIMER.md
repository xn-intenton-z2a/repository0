# TIMER with NOTIFICATION & SCHEDULING

## Overview
This update enhances the existing TIMER feature by not only providing a countdown timer with an optional desktop notification, but also by incorporating a scheduled command execution capability. In addition to its primary role of notifying users when a timer expires, the TIMER feature can now be used to trigger subsequent CLI commands automatically. This streamlines workflows by allowing users to schedule follow-up actions without manual intervention, thereby reinforcing the repository’s mission of promoting healthy collaboration and practical automation.

## CLI Integration
- **Command Flags:** The existing `--timer` flag is retained for setting the countdown duration. The `--notify` flag remains available to trigger a desktop notification (or audible alert) when the countdown ends.
- **New Scheduling Option:** A new optional flag `--schedule` can be appended along with a command string. When provided, the CLI will execute the specified command automatically after the timer reaches zero. For example:
  - `node src/lib/main.js --timer 10 --notify --schedule "--greet"`
    - This command starts a 10-second timer, sends a notification upon expiration, and then automatically runs the `--greet` command.

## Timer Logic, Notification, and Scheduled Execution
- **Timer Countdown:** The CLI accepts a numeric duration (in seconds) and initiates a countdown. It then waits for the specified duration before proceeding.
- **Notification Mechanism:** Upon completion of the countdown:
  - If `--notify` is enabled, the system attempts to trigger a native desktop notification or, if unsupported, displays an alert message in the console (e.g., "Timer finished!").
  - Output modes are supported both in plain text and JSON with metadata updates.
- **Scheduled Command Execution:**
  - **Activation:** When the `--schedule` flag is provided along with a valid CLI command (as a string), after the timer completes and any notification is dispatched, the tool automatically processes the scheduled command using the same CLI logic.
  - **Execution:** The scheduled command is executed in the same runtime environment, and its output is displayed immediately following the timer’s output. If JSON mode is active, the scheduled command’s output is also returned with the usual metadata fields.
  - **Fallback:** If execution of the scheduled command fails or yields an error, an error message is displayed or logged appropriately.

## Error Handling & Validation
- **Input Validation:**
  - The timer duration must be a positive numeric value. If the input is missing or invalid, a standardized error message is generated (e.g., "Error: Invalid timer duration provided.").
  - If the scheduled command string is provided, it is validated to ensure it is not empty.
- **Notification & Scheduling Errors:**
  - Notification failures are caught and reported as warnings without halting the timer’s functionality.
  - Any errors during the execution of the scheduled command are captured, and an error message is displayed, ensuring the tool remains robust.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Unit Tests:** Tests will simulate timer completion with and without the `--notify` flag, as well as with the new `--schedule` option. Scenarios include successful command execution, failures in scheduled command execution, and proper error handling when inputs are invalid.
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README to include examples demonstrating the new scheduling functionality.
  - For instance, document usage patterns such as:
    - `node src/lib/main.js --timer 10 --notify --schedule "--greet"`
    - `node src/lib/main.js --timer 5 --schedule "--sum 4 5"`
  - Inline comments in `src/lib/main.js` are updated to explain the scheduling logic and its integration with existing timer functions.

## Alignment with Repository Mission
By integrating scheduled command execution into the TIMER feature, this enhancement further supports automation workflows and reduces the need for manual intervention. It enables users to chain commands in a predictable manner and optimizes the utility of the CLI tool for proactive task management, thus aligning well with the repository’s mission of fostering healthy collaboration and streamlined automation in a modular, self-contained environment.
