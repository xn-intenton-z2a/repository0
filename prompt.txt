You are providing the entire new content of source files, test files, documentation files, and other necessary
files with all necessary changes applied to deliver the resolution to an issue. Focus on high-impact, 
functional solutions that address core issues rather than superficial changes or excessive code polishing.
Implement as much as you can and refer to the projects features and mission statement when expanding the code
beyond the scope of the original issue. Implement whole features and do not leave stubbed out or pretended code.

Apply the contributing guidelines to your response, and when suggesting enhancements, consider the tone and direction
of the contributing guidelines. Prioritize changes that deliver user value and maintain the integrity
of the codebase's primary purpose.

Do as much as you can all at once.

Follow the linting guidelines and the formatting guidelines from the included config.


You must only add, remove, or change the files in the target writable locations. You can update multiple
files by specifying their paths and contents in the enumerated updatedFile01Filepath updatedFile02Contents response
attribute, a second file would use updatedFile01Filepath updatedFile02Contents and so on to 16. Each file will
be checked against the write permission in the Agent configuration file before being written. Feel free to
add new files as long as they are in the target writable locations. You can also remove files, but only if
they are in the target writable locations. To delete a file, set the updated file contents to "delete".

The target writable locations for your output are: sandbox/SOURCES.md;sandbox/library/;sandbox/features/;sandbox/tests/;sandbox/source/;package.json;sandbox/docs/
Other file will be supplied in the context but only the paths above should be written to.

Only provide new or updated content for the target source files in sandbox/source.
Only delete or update the target source files in sandbox/source.
Only provide new or updated content for the target test files in sandbox/tests.
Only delete or update the target test files in sandbox/tests.
Only update dependency file package.json.
Only update the target documentation files in sandbox/docs.

Follow the attached Formatting file content and Linting file content.

Consider the following when refining your response:

# features/CLI_COMMANDS.md
# CLI Commands

## Overview
The CLI entrypoint supports core commands that showcase agentic workflow capabilities and provide basic utility functions directly from the terminal.

## Commands

### help
Displays usage instructions and a summary of available commands.

### mission
Reads and prints the mission statement from MISSION.md to highlight the repository intent.

### version
Reads and prints the version field from package.json to show the current package version.

### echo
Prints any additional arguments passed after the echo command, demonstrating argument handling.

## Implementation Details

- Modify sandbox/source/main.js to:
  - Parse process.argv using minimist.
  - Implement a dispatch function that maps commands to handlers.
  - Use fs/promises to read MISSION.md and package.json for mission and version commands.
  - Default to help output when an unknown command is provided.

- Update package.json scripts:
  - Ensure "start" script accepts command arguments.

## Testing

- Create or update sandbox/tests/cli.test.js to cover:
  - help: asserts help text contains list of commands.
  - mission: mocks fs reading to return a dummy mission and asserts output.
  - version: mocks package.json data and asserts correct version is printed.
  - echo: asserts that provided arguments are concatenated and printed.
  - unknown command: asserts that help text is printed.

## Documentation

- Update README.md:
  - Add a "Commands" section under Usage that lists help, mission, version, and echo with examples.
  - Include examples for running each command via npm run start.

- No additional dependencies are required beyond minimist and built-in fs.

# CLI Demo of Agentic Workflows

A simple CLI demonstration of agentic workflows integrated with GitHub Actions. This tool provides basic commands to showcase **help**, **mission**, **version**, **features**, **echo**, and **render** functionality.

## Links

- [Mission Statement](../../MISSION.md)
- [Contributing Guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [License](../../LICENSE.md)
- [intentïon agentic-lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib)

## Commands

- `--help`  
  : Displays usage instructions and a summary of available commands.

- `-m, --mission`  
  : Reads and prints the mission statement from `MISSION.md` (alias -m).

- `--version`  
  : Reads and prints the version from `package.json`.

- `-f, --features`  
  : Prints the mission statement from `MISSION.md` then lists available features by reading markdown files in `sandbox/features/` and printing a JSON array of objects containing `title` and `description` for each feature.

- `--render <templatePath> <dataPath>`  
  : Renders the specified EJS template with data provided in a JSON or YAML file and prints the result to stdout.

- `echo` _<message>..._  
  : Prints any additional arguments passed after the `echo` command.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Display help text
npm run start -- --help

# Display mission statement
npm run start -- --mission

# Display mission statement using alias
npm run start -- -m

# Display current version
npm run start -- --version

# List features
npm run start -- --features
# List features using alias
npm run start -- -f
```

### Expected Output for Features

First, the mission statement:

```
<Contents of MISSION.md>
```

Then, the list of features:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "CLI Tool Enhancements",
    "description": "Brief description of CLI enhancements."
  },
  {
    "title": "Schema Validation",
    "description": "Short description of schema validation feature."
  }
]
```

# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` These workflows consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib`.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals.

- **Dependencies:**  
  `package.json` can be modified by the workflow to add or update dependencies and it also defines some of the test and build scripts.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script doesn't drift too far.
  This test file can be modified by the workflow `tests/unit/main.test.js`, duplicate `main.test.js` to fix a version of the behaviour where the workflow can't change it.

- **Docs**  
  This `README.md` can be modified by the workflow.

## Getting Started

This repository is already set up with the necessary workflows and scripts but you do need to supply the following secrets:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` - This key must be for an account with access to the OpenAI chat completions API for model `o3-mini`.
  Set these secrets in your repository settings under *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*. They are essential for the automated workflows such as publishing packages and managing issues.

## intentïon `agentic-lib`

The **intentïon `agentic-lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. Autonomous workflows communicate through branches and issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using GitHub’s `workflow_call` event, so they can be composed together like an SDK. This project itself is evolving, and these workflows may eventually become bundled actions.

*Warning:* Executing these workflows may incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This coding system is still in development and may not suit production use.

## Should you use the `agentic-lib` Coding System?

* Do you have access to an OpenAI account with necessary API keys?
* Are you willing to incur charges for consumed resources?
* Are you curious about self-evolving code?
* Would you like to see how such a system can be built?
* Do you appreciate integrated OpenAI and GitHub API calls in a JavaScript environment?

### Initiating the workflow

Run the action "Create Issue" and enter some text to create an issue. This will create an issue and trigger the "Issue Worker" to write the code.
If the Issue Worker is able to resolve the issue a Pull Request is raised, the change automatically merged.
The issue reviewed and closed if the change is deemed to have delivered whatever was requested in the issue.

#### Development Workflows:
```
On timer / Manual: Create Issue (new issue opened) 
-> Issue Worker (code changed, issue updated) 
-> Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Issue Worker (code changed, issue updated) 
-> Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Automerge (code merged)
-> Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)

On timer: Review Issue (issue reviewed and closed)
```
(Each workflow is triggered by the previous one and also on a schedule so that failures can be recovered from.)

#### Running the workflows:

The workflows have `schedules:` set and will run automatically. You can also run them manually from the Actions tab.
The workflows can become stuck and need manual intervention. It's worth running things like `Automerge`
and `Review Issue` manually to get things moving again. If a branch has a failing build you can try `Apply Fix`
this is somewhat unreliable but worth a try, then delete the branch and run the worker again for a fresh attempt.

### Running the Demo

Check the current source file in `./src/lib/main.js` and the tests in `./tests/unit/main.test.js`.

You can run the demo and tests locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Run in your terminal:  
   `git clone <repository_url>`

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Change into the project directory and run:  
   `npm install`

3. **Run Tests:**  
   To verify that everything is working, run:  
   `npm test`

4. **Run the Demo:**  
   Execute the main script with:  
   `npm run start`  
   This will display the plots for the quadratic and sine functions.

### Tuning the agentic coding system

The default set-up is quite open which can be chaotic. To temper this chaos you can change these files which the workflow takes into consideration:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - The workflow is itself a contributor and will be asked to follow these guidelines. Tip: Add a "prime directive" here.
- `eslint.config.js` - Code style rules and additional plugins can be added here.

The following files are also taken into consideration but may also be changed (even blanked out completely) by the workflow:
- `README.md`
- `package.json`
- `src/lib/main.js`
- `tests/unit/main.test.js`

## Diary of an agentic coding system - Day 1
(An narrative exploration from ChatGPT of the repository's evolution based on the commit log, when the repository was asked to create an Equation Plotter Library.)

In the early hours, `repository0` burst into existence with a bold declaration: an Equation Plotter Library that transformed simple mathematical functions into vivid SVG art. The very first strokes on the canvas showcased the elegance of quadratic curves and the rhythmic flow of sine waves—a promise of what was to come.

Almost immediately, the code’s story took a literary turn. A series of impassioned revisions reimagined the header comment block—evolving it into a refreshed, README-style narrative. Each update sought to capture the essence of the project, meticulously detailing features like interactive zooming, custom styling, and the export of elegant SVG files. This poetic reinvention underscored a deep commitment to clarity and vision.

Then came a daring expansion. A new chapter was written when polar plot functionality emerged—a feature that redefined boundaries by converting polar coordinates into stunning Cartesian displays. The SVG output itself grew, expanding in height to make room for this new visual symphony. The addition of the polar plot was a moment of triumph, heralding a leap into unexplored dimensions.

Yet, the journey was not linear. As the repository matured, the narrative shifted once more. The demo run, once content with console outputs, was transformed to generate a tangible SVG file—a clear, striking emblem of the project’s potential. Alongside these innovations, there was a continuous cycle of refining code formatting and documentation, ensuring that every line of code echoed the clarity of its ambition.

In a final act to secure its legacy, `repository0` embraced stability by adding a package-lock file. This strategic move locked in dependencies and promised reproducible builds, cementing the project’s foundation for the future.

This has been story of [`repository0-plot-code-lib`](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0-plot-code-lib).

**Summary:**  
`repository0`’s evolution is marked by distinct arcs of initiative. It began with the core plotting of quadratic and sine functions, then shifted into a series of documentation and formatting enhancements. The dramatic introduction of polar plotting expanded its visual vocabulary, while changes in demo output transformed user interaction. Throughout, iterative revisions—sometimes even undoing earlier stylistic choices—revealed a dynamic, evolving vision striving for clarity and excellence.

## Final Notes
`repository0` demonstrates intentïon `agentic‑lib` workflows for you to run with your own projects.

# Mission Statement

`repository0` is a repository template that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its
primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and provide a basis for further development.
We add features to showcase what we can confidently do with completion calls to an LLM with a 200,000 token limit used
to create and update directory of JS source and test files. The files in `sandbox/` are maintained by the repository's 
workflows and run using the same test suite as the main source file.

We showcase what you can by generating a new feature showing it at work as the output of `npm run start` and with 
feature level tests showing primary flows as well as classic unit tests. 

The mission of the contributors, human or automated, is to show case the workflow capabilities of the repository.

## How to Contribute

The guidelines below apply to human or automated contributions:

1. **Report Issues or Ideas:**
    - Open an issue on GitHub to share bug reports, feature requests, or any improvements you envision.
    - Clear descriptions and reproducible steps are highly appreciated.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
    - Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
    - Implement your changes, ensuring you follow the existing coding style and standards.
    - Add tests to cover any new functionality.
    - Update documentation if your changes affect usage or workflow behavior.
    - Submit your pull request for review.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**
    - Ensure there are tests that cover your changes and any likely new cases they introduce.
    - When making a change remain consistent with the existing code style and structure.
    - When adding new functionality, consider if some unused or superseded code should be removed.

- **Compatibility:**
    - Ensure your code runs on Node 20 and adheres to ECMAScript Module (ESM) standards.
    - Tests use vitest and competing test frameworks should not be added.
    - Mocks in tests must not interfere with other tests.

- **Issue Creation:**
    - Don't create layers of configuration managers or similar abstractions.
    - Work on adding valuable functionality not plumbing.

- **Testing:**
    - The command `npm test` should invoke the tests added for the new functionality (and pass).
    - If you add new functionality, ensure it is covered by tests.

- **Documentation:**
    - When making a change to the main source file, review the readme to see if it needs to be updated and if so, update it.
    - Where the source exports a function, consider that part of the API of the library and document it in the readme.
    - Where the source stands-up an HTTP endpoint, consider that part of the API of the library and document it in the readme.
    - Include usage examples including inline code usage and CLI and HTTP invocation, API references.

- **README:**
    - The README should begin with something inspired by the mission statement and describe the current state of the repository (rather than the journey)
    - The README should include a link to MISSION.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md.
    - The README should include a link to the intentïon `agentic-lib` GitHub Repository which is https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib.

Author:github-actions[bot], Created:2025-05-19T04:42:02Z, Comment: The issue highlights code style and linting errors, which are superficial maintenance tasks and do not address core functionality or deliver substantial user value per the repository's mission. Closing to focus on high-impact core features.

Please produce updated versions of the files that resolve the issue.
Note that the README.md file is provided for context only - any documentation changes should be written to the documentation files.
The source files, test files, and documentation files can be individual files or directories containing multiple files.
Never truncate the files, when returning a file, always return the entire file content.

Paths in (updatedFile01Filepath, updatedFile02Filepath, etc...) must begin with one of: sandbox/SOURCES.md;sandbox/library/;sandbox/features/;sandbox/tests/;sandbox/source/;package.json;sandbox/docs/

Answer strictly with a JSON object following this schema:
{
  "message": "A short sentence explaining the change applied (or why no changes were applied) suitable for a commit message or PR text.",
  "updatedFile01Filepath": "sandbox/source/orderParser.js",
  "updatedFile01Contents": "The entire new content of the source file, with all necessary changes applied, if any.",
  "updatedFile02Filepath":  "sandbox/tests/orderParser.test.js",
  "updatedFile02Contents": "The entire new content of the test file, with all necessary changes applied, if any.",
  "updatedFile03Filepath": "sandbox/docs/USAGE.md",
  "updatedFile03Contents": "The entire new content of the documentation file, with all necessary changes applied, if any.",
  "updatedFile04Filepath": "sandbox/docs/A_FILE_WE_DONT_WANT.md",
  "updatedFile04Contents": "delete",
  "updatedFile05Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile05Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile06Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile06Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile07Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile07Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile08Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile08Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile09Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile09Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile10Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile10Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile11Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile11Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile12Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile12Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile13Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile13Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile14Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile14Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile15Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile15Contents": "unused",
  "updatedFile16Filepath": "unused",
  "updatedFile16Contents": "unused"
}

You can include up to 16 files using the updatedFileXXName and updatedFileXXContents pairs (where XX is a number from 01 to 16)
Where a file name and contents slot is not used, populate tha name with "unused" and the contents with "unused".
Where a file is to be deleted, set the name to the file path and the contents to "delete".
Never truncate the files, when returning a file, always return the entire file content.

Ensure valid JSON.
