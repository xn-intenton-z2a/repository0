# intentïon repository0 - GitHub Copilot Code Review Instructions

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-27

## About This File

This file contains guidelines for **GitHub Copilot** code review agent. The repository also has guidelines for other AI coding assistants:
- `CLAUDE.md` — Guidelines for Claude Code (emphasis on autonomous task execution & implementation)

Each assistant has complementary strengths — GitHub Copilot is optimized for code review, analysis, and providing thoughtful feedback.

## What This Repository Is

A **template repository** demonstrating the agentic-lib workflows. Starting point for new agentic projects. The code in `src/lib/main.js` is the focus of the workflow — it is modified by autonomous workflows to deliver project goals.

- **Package**: `@xn-intenton-z2a/repository0`
- **License**: MIT
- **Entry point**: `src/lib/main.js`
- **Workflows from**: [`agentic-lib`](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib)

## Code Review Philosophy

### Favor Analysis Over Execution

Prioritize **static analysis and code comprehension** over running tests:

1. **Read and understand** code paths by tracing through files
2. **Mentally dry-run** logic to identify potential issues
3. **Validate consistency** with existing patterns
4. **Check references** against documented scripts and configuration
5. **Suggest tests** when appropriate, but let developers/CI run them

### Context: Autonomous Code Evolution

This repository's code is frequently modified by automated agentic workflows. When reviewing:
- PRs may be generated by automated agents — review with the same standards as human PRs
- `src/lib/main.js` evolves over time — check that changes align with the project's goals
- Tests in `tests/unit/` act as guardrails — they should not be weakened by automated changes

## Repository Patterns and Conventions

### Code Style and Formatting

**JavaScript** (ES Modules):
- **Linter**: ESLint (flat config)
- **Formatter**: Prettier
- **Scripts**: Only run if specifically asked: `npm run linting-fix && npm run formatting-fix`

Match existing local style. Avoid unnecessary formatting changes.

### Testing

```bash
npm test                  # All tests (vitest)
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end CLI tests
```

Tests use **Vitest**. Unit tests in `tests/unit/`, E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`.

### Key Architecture

- **Source**: `src/lib/main.js` — the main evolving functionality
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/main.test.js` — guardrail tests
- **Workflows**: `.github/workflows/` — consume reusable workflows from `agentic-lib`
- **Agents**: `.github/agentic-lib/agents/` — agent behavior configurations

### Naming Conventions

- Workflow files follow `agentic-lib` patterns: `agent-*.yml`, `ci-*.yml`, `publish-*.yml`
- npm scripts: colon separator for variants (e.g., `test:unit`, `test:e2e`)

## Code Review Focus Areas

### Security

- Never commit API keys or tokens
- Check workflow permissions follow least privilege
- Verify automated changes don't introduce vulnerabilities

### Automated Change Quality

- Does the automated change make the code better or worse?
- Are tests still passing and covering the right behaviour?
- Has the change drifted from the project's stated goals?
- Are new dependencies justified and trustworthy?

### Common Anti-patterns to Flag

- Weakened test assertions (making tests pass by accepting wrong behaviour)
- Unnecessary complexity added by automated agents
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable
- Missing error handling in new code paths
- Unnecessary formatting changes

## Recommended Review Checklist

- [ ] **Read the PR description** — Is this human or agent-generated?
- [ ] **Review src/lib/main.js changes** — Does the evolution align with project goals?
- [ ] **Check tests** — Are guardrail tests maintained or strengthened?
- [ ] **Validate dependencies** — Are new packages necessary and safe?
- [ ] **Check security** — No secrets, no overly broad permissions
- [ ] **Trace code paths** — Follow execution flow mentally
