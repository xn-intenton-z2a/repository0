---

### 1. Workflow Structure
- Workflows must be stored in `.github/workflows` directory.
- YAML file components: `name`, `run-name`, `on` for triggers, and `jobs` for executing steps.
- Use reserved context variables like `${{ github.actor }}`, `${{ github.event_name }}`, `${{ runner.os }}`.

### 2. Event Triggers
- Define events with `on:` key. Accepted values: `push`, `fork`, `pull_request`, etc.
- Example: `on: [push]` strictly triggers on push events.

### 3. Jobs & Steps
- Jobs are independent units defined under `jobs`.
- Each job has a `runs-on` parameter (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
- Steps within a job can execute shell commands (using `run`) or call actions (using `uses`).
- Dependency management is achieved via the `needs` keyword to run jobs sequentially.

### 4. Advanced Configurations
#### Secrets and Environment Variables
- Define secrets in repository settings and reference them using `${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}`.

#### Matrix Strategy
- Use `strategy.matrix` to run multiple instances of a job. For example:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16]
```

#### Caching
- Use `actions/cache@v4` to cache dependencies:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

#### Service Containers
- Use the `services` keyword to define ephemeral containers. Sample:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
```

### 5. Full YAML Example

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

### Workflow YAML File Configuration
- File Path: `.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml`
- File Name Extension: `.yml` or `.yaml` (YAML syntax used for configuration).

### Configuration Options and Their Effects

1. `name` (String): The display name of the workflow.
2. `run-name` (String): A dynamic name showcasing runtime variables like `${{ github.actor }}`.
3. `on` (List): Specifies one or more GitHub event triggers (e.g., `[push]`).
4. `jobs` (Mapping): Contains one or more job definitions.
   - `runs-on`: Specifies the runner environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
   - `steps`: A sequential list of steps; each step can use:
       a. `run`: Shell command execution (supports multi-line with `|`).
       b. `uses`: Calls an action, e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`.

### Detailed Implementation Steps

- Ensure repository has a `.github/workflows` directory.
- Commit a new workflow file with the above YAML to trigger on push events.
- After committing, verify workflow execution under the Actions tab in the repository.
- To troubleshoot, inspect job logs and expanded step details in the GitHub Actions UI.

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for steps and jobs to simplify log interpretation.
- Leverage context variables for dynamic reporting and secure secrets management.
- Implement job dependency using `needs` to manage complex workflows.
- Use caching for dependency directories to improve workflow performance.
- Utilize matrix strategies when testing across multiple environments.

### SDK Method Signatures (Hypothetical Example for GitHub Actions SDK)

Assuming a Node.js SDK interface for GitHub Actions interactions:

```javascript
/**
 * Triggers a workflow run for a repository.
 * @param {string} repo - Repository name in 'owner/repo' format.
 * @param {string} workflowFile - Filename of the workflow YAML.
 * @param {object} inputs - Key-value pairs for workflow inputs.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} API response containing run details.
 */
async function triggerWorkflow(repo, workflowFile, inputs) {
  // Implementation code
}

/**
 * Retrieves the status of a workflow run.
 * @param {string} runId - The ID of the workflow run.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} API response with status details.
 */
async function getWorkflowRunStatus(runId) {
  // Implementation code

## Workflow Structure

A GitHub Actions workflow is defined by a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each workflow must include:

- One or more trigger events (`on` field) such as `push`, `pull_request`, etc.
- A list of jobs. Each job contains:
  - `runs-on`: the runner OS (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`)
  - Steps which include shell commands (`run`) or actions (`uses`), with support for context variables like `${{ github.event_name }}`, `${{ runner.os }}`.

## Example Workflow YAML

This is an exact YAML workflow definition for the demo:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Components and Specifications

### Triggers (Events)

- `on: [push]` causes the workflow to run on any push. Other events include `fork`, `pull_request`, and `repository_dispatch`.

### Jobs

- Jobs run on a specified runner (e.g. `ubuntu-latest`). They can run sequentially using `needs` or in parallel by default.
- Each job includes steps that can be shell commands or use pre-built actions.

### Steps

- Steps can call actions by using the `uses` syntax with a version tag (e.g. `actions/checkout@v4`).
- Direct shell commands are defined under `run`.

## Advanced Workflow Features

- **Secrets and Environment Variables**: Expose values via `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` in the YAML file. 
- **Matrix Strategy**: Define a matrix to run values across multiple parameters, e.g. different Node.js versions:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16]
```

- **Caching Dependencies**: Use the `actions/cache` action to cache folders. Example:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
```

- **Container and Service Support**: Workflows can run steps inside a container or connect to ephemeral service containers like Postgres.
