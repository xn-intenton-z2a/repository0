For example, a question that you ask Copilot Chat, or a code snippet that you ask Copilot to complete. In addition to your prompt, Copilot uses additional context, like the code in your current file and the chat history, to generate a response.
Follow the tips in this article to write prompts that generate better responses from Copilot.
Start general, then get specific
When writing a prompt for Copilot, first give Copilot a broad description of the goal or scenario. Then list any specific requirements.
For example:

Write a function that tells me if a number is prime
The function should take an integer and return true if the integer is prime
The function should error if the input is not a positive integer

Give examples
Use examples to help Copilot understand what you want. You can provide example input data, example outputs, and example implementations.
For example:

Write a function that finds all dates in a string and returns them in an array. Dates can be formatted like:

05/02/24
05/02/2024
5/2/24
5/2/2024
05-02-24
05-02-2024
5-2-24
5-2-2024

Example:
findDates("I have a dentist appointment on 11/14/2023 and book club on 12-1-23")
Returns: ["11/14/2023", "12-1-23"]

Unit tests can also serve as examples. Before writing your function, you can use Copilot to write unit tests for the function. Then, you can ask Copilot to write a function described by those unit tests.
Break complex tasks into simpler tasks
If you want Copilot to complete a complex or large task, break the task into multiple simple, small tasks.
For example, instead of asking Copilot to generate a word search puzzle, break the process down into smaller tasks, and ask Copilot to accomplish them one by one:

Write a function to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters.
Write a function to find all words in a grid of letters, given a list of valid words.
Write a function that uses the previous functions to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters that contains at least 10 words.
Update the previous function to print the grid of letters and 10 random words from the grid.

Avoid ambiguity
Avoid ambiguous terms. For example, don’t ask "what does this do" if "this" could be the current file, the last Copilot response, or a specific code block. Instead, be specific:

What does the createUser function do?
What does the code in your last response do?

Ambiguity can also apply to libraries:

If you are using an uncommon library, describe what the library does.
If you want to use a specific library, set the import statements at the top of the file or specify what library you want to use.

Indicate relevant code
If you are using Copilot in your IDE to get suggestions as you code, open any relevant files and close irrelevant files. Copilot will use the open files to understand your request.
If you are using Copilot Chat in your IDE, open the file or highlight the code that you want Copilot to reference. You can also use keywords to manually supply context to Copilot Chat. For example, you can add the @workspace chat participant in VS Code, or @project in JetBrains IDEs. See GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet.
Experiment and iterate
If you don’t get the result that you want, iterate on your prompt and try again.
If you are using Copilot to get suggestions as you code, you can delete the suggestion entirely and start over. Or you can keep the suggestion and request modifications.
If you are using Copilot Chat, you can reference the previous response in your next request. Or, you can delete the previous response and start over.
Keep history relevant
Copilot Chat uses the chat history to get context about your request. To give Copilot only the relevant history:

Use threads to start a new conversation for a new task
Delete requests that are no longer relevant or that didn’t give you the desired result

Follow good coding practices
If you aren't getting the responses you want when you ask Copilot for suggestions or explanations in your codebase, make sure that your existing code follows best practices and is easy to read. For example:

Use a consistent code style and patterns
Use descriptive names for variables and functions
Comment your code
Structure your code into modular, scoped components
Include unit tests

Tip

Use Copilot to help your code follow best practices. For example, ask Copilot to add comments or to break a large function into smaller functions.

On GitHub, you can use Copilot Chat to ask different questions in different contexts. For example, you can ask about a specific repository, a specific issue, or a specific pull request. You can also ask general questions about software development, or about a specific programming language.
Limitations
The quality of the results from Copilot Chat may, in some situations, be degraded if very large files, or a large number of files, are used as a context for a question.
Viewing and editing generated files within Copilot Chat
Note

This feature is currently in public preview and subject to change.

When you ask a question, Copilot may generate one or more files as part of its response. In the Copilot Chat panel, the files are displayed inline, within the chat response. In immersive view (that is, at https://github.com/copilot), the generated files are displayed in a side panel. You can view and edit the files in the panel, or download them to your computer.
For example, asking Generate a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript may generate multiple files, such as index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
In immersive view, you can also preview how some file formats, such as Markdown, render by toggling to the "Preview" tab in the side panel.
Powered by skills
When using the GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet models, Copilot has access to a collection of skills to fetch data from GitHub, which are dynamically selected based on the question you ask. You can tell which skill Copilot used by clicking  to expand the status information in the chat window.

You can explicitly ask GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub to use a particular skill - for example, Use the Bing skill to find the latest GPT4 model from OpenAI.
You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: What skills are available?
Customizing Copilot Chat responses
GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, the specifics of your project, or your personal preferences, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeating instructions in each prompt, you can create and save instructions for Copilot Chat to customize what responses you receive.
There are two types of custom instructions you can add for Copilot Chat:

Repository instructions: You can create a custom instructions file for a repository, so that all prompts asked in the context of the repository automatically include the instructions you've defined
Personal instructions: You can add personal instructions so that all the chat responses you, as a user, receive are tailored to your preferences

For more information, see Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot and Adding personal custom instructions for GitHub Copilot.
AI models for Copilot Chat
You can change the large language model that Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts, including premium models with advanced capabilities. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. For more information see Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat.
Submitting a question to Copilot Chat
You can open Copilot Chat from any page on GitHub. Certain questions may require you to be in a specific context, such as a repository, issue, or pull request. The following procedure describes how to ask a general software related question, and demonstrates the core functionality of Copilot Chat on GitHub. For more information on other scenarios, see Asking Copilot Chat questions in different contexts.
Depending on the question you ask, and your enterprise and organization settings, Copilot may respond using information based on the results of a Bing search. By using Bing search, Copilot can answer a broad range of tech-related questions with up-to-date details based on information currently available on the internet. For information on how to enable or disable Bing search integration, see Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber and Managing policies and features for Copilot in your enterprise.


At the top right of any page on GitHub, click  beside the  icon and click Immersive in the dropdown menu.



At the bottom of the page, in the "Ask Copilot" box, type a question and press Enter.
Some examples of general questions you could ask are:

What are the advantages of the Go programming language?
What is Agile software development?
What is the most popular JavaScript framework?
Give me some examples of regular expressions.
Write a bash script to output today's date.



Optionally, after submitting a question, you can click  in the text box to stop the response.


If Copilot uses a Bing search to answer your question, "Using web search results for 'SEARCH QUERY'" is displayed above the response. Click this to see the search results that Copilot used to answer your question.


Within a conversation thread, you can ask follow-up questions. Copilot will answer within the context of the conversation. For example, you could type "tell me more" to get Copilot to expand on its last comment.
You can use your initial question as a foundation for follow-up questions. A detailed foundational prompt can help Copilot provide more relevant answers to your follow-up questions. For more information, see Prompting GitHub Copilot Chat to become your personal AI assistant for accessibility on the GitHub Blog.


To start a new conversation, click  at the top left of the page.

Regenerating a response with a different model
Note

This feature is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

After Copilot responds to your question, you can regenerate the same prompt using a different model by clicking the retry icon () below the response. The new response will use your selected model and maintain the full context of the conversation.
You can switch between responses to compare the results from different models.
For help deciding which model to use, see Choosing the right AI model for your task.
Using subthreads in a conversation
Note

Subthreading in Copilot Chat is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

Subthreads are branches of a conversation that are created from a point in a conversation where you asked a question. Subthreads offer more control and flexibility for exploring aspects of a topic, or new topics, all within the same thread.
You can create and navigate through subthreads in Copilot Chat's immersive view. In the Copilot Chat panel, if you open a conversation that contains subthreads, only the most recently edited subthread is displayed.
You can create a subthread in immersive mode by either editing or retrying any of your questions in the conversation.
To edit a question:


Hover over the question you want to edit.


Click the  button that's displayed.



Edit the question, then click Send.


Note

You can only edit the text of a question. You can't edit any attachments.

Create and install a GitHub App2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent locally3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent in a codespace3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension2. Clone and start the Blackbeard agent locally3. Expose your local server4. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extensionNext stepsThe Blackbeard extension is a GitHub Copilot Extension built with a simple agent that responds to requests like a pirate using Copilot's large language model (LLM) API and special system prompts. This guide uses a simple agent implementation, but the process is similar for skillsets.
This quickstart is designed to help you build and chat with the Blackbeard extension as quickly as possible, so you can develop and test your extension without deploying infrastructure. For production, you'll need to host the application for your agent or skillset's endpoints on a publicly accessible server. To instead learn how to create a new GitHub Copilot Extension, see Setting up Copilot Extensions.
1. Create and install a GitHub App
In the developer settings for your GitHub account, create a GitHub App. Your GitHub App must have:

A name
A homepage URL
Webhooks deselected

After you create your app, click Install App in the sidebar, then install your app on your account.
For detailed instructions, see Creating a GitHub App for your Copilot Extension.

2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent locally
Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent locally for a significantly faster build process.

Using the Terminal built into VS Code, clone the copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension repository.
In the same Terminal, run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, then run npm start to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.
In the "Ports" tab of the VS Code panel, click Forward a port or Add port, then add port 3000.
Right-click the port and set the visibility to "Public," then copy the local address.

3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension
After you set up your GitHub App and Blackbeard agent, you can integrate the agent with your app and test the Blackbeard extension. You need to make the following changes to your GitHub App settings:

In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the local address for your agent.
In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing @YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME in the Copilot Chat window, then sending a prompt as normal.
For more detailed instructions, see Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension.


2. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent in a codespace
Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent in a codespace for a significantly faster build process.

Navigate to the copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension repository. Select the  Code  dropdown menu, then click Create codespace on main.
To find your new codespace, select the  Code  dropdown menu. Next to your new codespace, select , then click  Open in Browser.
In the integrated Terminal, run npm start to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.
In the "Ports" tab of the VS Code panel, click Forward a port, then add port 3000.
Right-click the port and set the visibility to "Public," then copy the local address.

3. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension
After you set up your GitHub App and Blackbeard agent, you can integrate the agent with your app and test the Blackbeard extension. You need to make the following changes to your GitHub App settings:

In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the forwarded address for your agent.
In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing @YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME in the Copilot Chat window of a supported client or IDE, then sending a prompt as normal. For a list of supported clients and IDEs, see About building Copilot Extensions.
Note
 Chatting with GitHub Copilot Extensions in GitHub Codespaces is not supported.

For more detailed instructions, see Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension.


2. Clone and start the Blackbeard agent locally
Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent locally for a significantly faster build process.

Using your command line application, clone the copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension repository.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, then run npm start to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.

3. Expose your local server
To make the Blackbeard agent accessible to the Copilot platform and GitHub, you need to expose your local server so it's reachable by HTTP requests. You can use any port forwarding or tunneling service to achieve this. For the following steps, we'll use ngrok.


Navigate to ngrok's download page, then install the appropriate version of ngrok for your operating system.


Navigate to the ngrok setup and installation page, then log in or sign up for an ngrok account.


To expose your local server, in a new window of your command line application, run the following command:
Shellngrok http http://localhost:3000
ngrok http http://localhost:3000



In your command line application, next to "Forwarding," copy the URL that ngrok assigned to your server.


4. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension
To integrate your GitHub App with the Blackbeard agent, you need to make the following changes to your app settings:

In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the URL for your exposed server.
In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing @YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME in the Copilot Chat window, then sending a prompt as normal.
For more detailed instructions, see Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension.

Next steps
Now that you have a working GitHub Copilot Extension, you can try building on the Blackbeard agent to experiment with agent development.
To learn about more complex agent implementations, you can also review the following example agents and software development kit (SDK), all of which are available in the copilot-extensions organization:

GitHub Models: A more complex agent that lets you ask about and interact with various LLMs listed on the GitHub Marketplace through Copilot Chat. The GitHub Models agent makes use of function calling.
Function Calling: An example agent written in Go that demonstrates function calling and confirmation dialogs.
RAG Extension: An example agent written in Go that demonstrates a simple implementation of retrieval augmented generation.
Preview SDK: An SDK that streamlines the development of Copilot Extensions by handling request verification, payload parsing, and response formatting automatically. This SDK allows extension builders to focus more on creating core functionality and less on boilerplate code.\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions documentation Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions.

called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.In this articleUsing GitSetting up GitAuthenticating with GitHub from GitNext stepsUsing Git
To use Git on the command line, you will need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer. You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub from the command line. For more information, see About GitHub CLI.
If you want to work with Git locally, but do not want to use the command line, you can download and install the GitHub Desktop client. For more information, see About GitHub Desktop.
If you do not need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:

Quickstart for repositories
Fork a repository
Managing files

Setting up Git


Download and install the latest version of Git.
Note

Most Chrome OS devices from 2020 onwards now have a built-in Linux environment, which includes Git. To enable it, go to the Launcher, search for Linux, and click Turn on.
If you are using an older Chrome OS device, another method is required:

Install a terminal emulator such as Termux from the Google Play Store on your Chrome OS device.
From the terminal emulator that you installed, install Git. For example, in Termux, enter apt install git and then type y when prompted.




Set your username in Git.


Set your commit email address in Git.


Authenticating with GitHub from Git
When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you will need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.
Note

You can authenticate to GitHub using GitHub CLI, for either HTTP or SSH. For more information, see gh auth login.

Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)
If you clone with HTTPS, you can cache your GitHub credentials in Git using a credential helper. For more information, see About remote repositories and Caching your GitHub credentials in Git.
Connecting over SSH
If you clone with SSH, you must generate SSH keys on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub. For more information, see About remote repositories and Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent.
Next steps
You now have Git and GitHub all set up. You may now choose to create a repository where you can put your projects. Saving your code in a repository allows you to back up your code and share it around the world.


Creating a repository for your project allows you to store code in GitHub. This provides a backup of your work that you can choose to share with other developers. For more information, see Quickstart for repositories.


Forking a repository will allow you to make changes to another repository without affecting the original. For more information, see Fork a repository.


Each repository on GitHub is owned by a person or an organization. You can interact with the people, repositories, and organizations by connecting and following them on GitHub. For more information, see Finding inspiration on GitHub.


GitHub has a great support community where you can ask for help and talk to people from around the world. Join the conversation on GitHub Community.\n\n\n\nAuthentication/Connect with SSHConnecting to GitHub with SSHYou can connect to GitHub using the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), which provides a secure channel over an unsecured network.About SSHUsing the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit. You can also use an SSH key to sign commits.Using SSH agent forwardingTo simplify deploying to a server, you can set up SSH agent forwarding to securely use local SSH keys.Managing deploy keysLearn different ways to manage SSH keys on your servers when you automate deployment scripts and which way is best for you.Checking for existing SSH keysBefore you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agentAfter you've checked for existing SSH keys, you can generate a new SSH key to use for authentication, then add it to the ssh-agent.Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub accountTo configure your account on GitHub.com to use your new (or existing) SSH key, you'll also need to add the key to your account.Testing your SSH connectionAfter you've set up your SSH key and added it to GitHub, you can test your connection.Working with SSH key passphrasesYou can secure your SSH keys and configure an authentication agent so that you won't have to reenter your passphrase every time you use your SSH keys.\n\n\n\nRepositories/Create & manage repositoriesCreating and managing repositoriesYou can create a repository on GitHub to store and collaborate on your project's files, then manage the repository's name and location.About repositoriesA repository contains all of your code, your files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.Best practices for repositoriesLearn how to use repositories effectively and securely.Quickstart for repositoriesLearn how to create a new repository and commit your first change in 5 minutes.Repository limitsLearn about limitations for repositories.Creating a new repositoryYou can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions.Creating a repository from a templateYou can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as an existing repository.Creating a template repositoryYou can make an existing repository a template, so you and others can generate new repositories with the same directory structure, branches, and files.Creating an issues-only repositoryGitHub does not provide issues-only access permissions, but you can accomplish this using a second repository which contains only the issues.Duplicating a repositoryTo maintain a mirror of a repository without forking it, you can run a special clone command, then mirror-push to the new repository.Cloning a repositoryWhen you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository.

To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading


When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.
Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote

Quoted text is indented with a vertical line on the left and displayed using gray type.

Note

When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing R. You can quote an entire comment by clicking , then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see Keyboard shortcuts.

Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.


To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```


For more information, see Creating and highlighting code blocks.
If you are frequently editing code snippets and tables, you may benefit from enabling a fixed-width font in all comment fields on GitHub. For more information, see About writing and formatting on GitHub.
Supported color models
In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.
The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.


Here are the currently supported color models.





























ColorSyntaxExampleOutputHEX`#RRGGBB``#0969DA`RGB`rgb(R,G,B)``rgb(9, 105, 218)`HSL`hsl(H,S,L)``hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`
Note


A supported color model cannot have any leading or trailing spaces within the backticks.
The visualization of the color is only supported in issues, pull requests, and discussions.


Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.
You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Note

GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see Autolinked references and URLs.

Section links
You can link directly to any section that has a heading. To view the automatically generated anchor in a rendered file, hover over the section heading to expose the  icon and click the icon to display the anchor in your browser.

If you need to determine the anchor for a heading in a file you are editing, you can use the following basic rules:

Letters are converted to lower-case.
Spaces are replaced by hyphens (-). Any other whitespace or punctuation characters are removed.
Leading and trailing whitespace are removed.
Markup formatting is removed, leaving only the contents (for example, _italics_ becomes italics).
If the automatically generated anchor for a heading is identical to an earlier anchor in the same document, a unique identifier is generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer.

For more detailed information on the requirements of URI fragments, see RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax, Section 3.5.
The code block below demonstrates the basic rules used to generate anchors from headings in rendered content.
# Example headings

## Sample Section

## This'll be a _Helpful_ Section About the Greek Letter Θ!
A heading containing characters not allowed in fragments, UTF-8 characters, two consecutive spaces between the first and second words, and formatting.

## This heading is not unique in the file

TEXT 1

## This heading is not unique in the file

TEXT 2

# Links to the example headings above

Link to the sample section: [Link Text](#sample-section).

Link to the helpful section: [Link Text](#thisll-be-a-helpful-section-about-the-greek-letter-Θ).

Link to the first non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file).

Link to the second non-unique section: [Link Text](#this-heading-is-not-unique-in-the-file-1).

Note

If you edit a heading, or if you change the order of headings with "identical" anchors, you will also need to update any links to those headings as the anchors will change.

Relative links
You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.
A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:
[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. The path of the link will be relative to the current file. Links starting with / will be relative to the repository root. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../.
Your link text should be on a single line. The example below will not work.
[Contribution
guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.
Custom anchors
You can use standard HTML anchor tags (<a name="unique-anchor-name"></a>) to create navigation anchor points for any location in the document. To avoid ambiguous references, use a unique naming scheme for anchor tags, such as adding a prefix to the name attribute value.
Note

Custom anchors will not be included in the document outline/Table of Contents.

You can link to a custom anchor using the value of the name attribute you gave the anchor. The syntax is exactly the same as when you link to an anchor that is automatically generated for a heading.
For example:
# Section Heading

Some body text of this section.

<a name="my-custom-anchor-point"></a>
Some text I want to provide a direct link to, but which doesn't have its own heading.

(… more content…)

[A link to that custom anchor](#my-custom-anchor-point)

Tip

Custom anchors are not considered by the automatic naming and numbering behavior of automatic heading links.

Line breaks
If you're writing in issues, pull requests, or discussions in a repository, GitHub will render a line break automatically:
This example
Will span two lines

However, if you are writing in an .md file, the example above would render on one line without a line break. To create a line break in an .md file, you will need to include one of the following:


Include two spaces at the end of the first line.
This example  
Will span two lines



Include a backslash at the end of the first line.
This example\
Will span two lines



Include an HTML single line break tag at the end of the first line.
This example<br/>
Will span two lines



If you leave a blank line between two lines, both .md files and Markdown in issues, pull requests, and discussions will render the two lines separated by the blank line:
This example

Will have a blank line separating both lines

Images
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
![Screenshot of a comment on a GitHub issue showing an image, added in the Markdown, of an Octocat smiling and raising a tentacle.](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

GitHub supports embedding images into your issues, pull requests, discussions, comments and .md files. You can display an image from your repository, add a link to an online image, or upload an image. For more information, see Uploading assets.
Note

When you want to display an image that is in your repository, use relative links instead of absolute links.

Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.





























ContextRelative LinkIn a .md file on the same branch/assets/images/electrocat.pngIn a .md file on another branch/../main/assets/images/electrocat.pngIn issues, pull requests and comments of the repository../blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=trueIn a .md file in another repository/../../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.pngIn issues, pull requests and comments of another repository../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true
Note

The last two relative links in the table above will work for images in a private repository only if the viewer has at least read access to the private repository that contains these images.

For more information, see Relative Links.
The Picture element
The <picture> HTML element is supported.
Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +.
- George Washington
* John Adams
+ Thomas Jefferson


To order your list, precede each line with a number.
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams


Nested Lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.
To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Visual Studio Code, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

Note

In the web-based editor, you can indent or dedent one or more lines of text by first highlighting the desired lines and then using Tab or Shift+Tab respectively.



To create a nested list in the comment editor on GitHub, which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item.
In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item 100. First list item by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (100. ) before First list item.
100. First list item
     - First nested list item


You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven characters (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by at least two more characters (nine spaces minimum).
100. First list item
     - First nested list item
       - Second nested list item


For more examples, see the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec.
Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:


If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:
- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue
For more information, see About task lists.
Mentioning people and teams
You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see About notifications.
Note

A person will only be notified about a mention if the person has read access to the repository and, if the repository is owned by an organization, the person is a member of the organization.

@github/support What do you think about these updates?

When you mention a parent team, members of its child teams also receive notifications, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people. For more information, see About teams.
Typing an @ symbol will bring up a list of people or teams on a project. The list filters as you type, so once you find the name of the person or team you are looking for, you can use the arrow keys to select it and press either tab or enter to complete the name. For teams, enter the @organization/team-name and all members of that team will get subscribed to the conversation.
The autocomplete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread.
Referencing issues and pull requests
You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing #. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.
For more information, see Autolinked references and URLs.
Referencing external resources
If custom autolink references are configured for a repository, then references to external resources, like a JIRA issue or Zendesk ticket, convert into shortened links. To know which autolinks are available in your repository, contact someone with admin permissions to the repository. For more information, see Configuring autolinks to reference external resources.
Uploading assets
You can upload assets like images by dragging and dropping, selecting from a file browser, or pasting. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments, and .md files in your repository.
Using emojis
You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:, a colon followed by the name of the emoji.
@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:

Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.
For a full list of available emoji and codes, see the Emoji-Cheat-Sheet.
Paragraphs
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.
Footnotes
You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.

The footnote will render like this:

Note

The position of a footnote in your Markdown does not influence where the footnote will be rendered. You can write a footnote right after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render at the bottom of the Markdown. Footnotes are not supported in wikis.

Alerts
Alerts are a Markdown extension based on the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information. On GitHub, they are displayed with distinctive colors and icons to indicate the significance of the content.
Use alerts only when they are crucial for user success and limit them to one or two per article to prevent overloading the reader. Additionally, you should avoid placing alerts consecutively. Alerts cannot be nested within other elements.
To add an alert, use a special blockquote line specifying the alert type, followed by the alert information in a standard blockquote. Five types of alerts are available:
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

Here are the rendered alerts:

Hiding content with comments
You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.
<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->

Ignoring Markdown formatting
You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

For more information on backslashes, see Daring Fireball's Markdown Syntax.
Note

The Markdown formatting will not be ignored in the title of an issue or a pull request.

Disabling Markdown rendering
When viewing a Markdown file, you can click Code at the top of the file to disable Markdown rendering and view the file's source instead.

Disabling Markdown rendering enables you to use source view features, such as line linking, which is not possible when viewing rendered Markdown files.

About writing and formatting on GitHub
Working with advanced formatting
Quickstart for writing on GitHub\n\n\n\nPull requests/Collaborate with pull requests/Propose changes/About pull requestsAbout pull requestsLearn about pull requests and draft pull requests on GitHub. Pull requests communicate changes to a branch in a repository. Once a pull request is opened, you can review changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits.Platform navigationMacWindowsLinuxIn this articleAbout pull requestsDraft pull requestsDifferences between commits on compare and pull request pagesFurther readingAbout pull requests
A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch.
Note

When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:

If you're working in the shared repository model, we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request. While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes.
Be very careful when force pushing commits to a pull request. Force pushing changes the repository history and can corrupt your pull request. If other collaborators branch the project before a force push, the force push may overwrite commits that collaborators based their work on.


You can create pull requests on GitHub.com, with GitHub Desktop, in GitHub Codespaces, on GitHub Mobile, and when using GitHub CLI.
After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams. See Creating a pull request.
Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab.
Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request. By default, in public repositories, any user can submit reviews that approve or request changes to a pull request. Organization owners and repository admins can limit who is able to give approving pull request reviews or request changes. For more information, see Managing pull request reviews in your organization and Managing pull request reviews in your repository.
You can see information about the branch's current deployment status and past deployment activity on the "Conversation" tab. See Viewing deployment activity for your repository.
After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request. If you're working in a shared repository model, you create a pull request and you, or someone else, will merge your changes from your feature branch into the base branch you specify in your pull request. See Merging a pull request.
If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see About protected branches.
You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. For more information, see Linking a pull request to an issue.
Tip


To toggle between collapsing and expanding all outdated review comments in a pull request, hold down OptionAltAlt and click Show outdated or Hide outdated. For more shortcuts, see Keyboard shortcuts.
You can squash commits when merging a pull request to gain a more streamlined view of changes. See About pull request merges.


You can visit your dashboard to quickly find links to recently updated pull requests you're working on or subscribed to. See About your personal dashboard.
Draft pull requests
Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free for organizations and legacy per-repository billing plans. Draft pull requests are also available in public and private repositories with GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see GitHub’s plans.
When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is ready for review or a draft pull request. Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests. See Creating a pull request and Creating a pull request from a fork.
When you're ready to get feedback on your pull request, you can mark your draft pull request as ready for review. Marking a pull request as ready for review will request reviews from any code owners. You can convert a pull request to a draft at any time. See Changing the stage of a pull request.
Differences between commits on compare and pull request pages
The compare and pull request pages use different methods to calculate the diff for changed files:

Compare pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the current common ancestor (that is, the merge base) of the head and base ref.
Pull request pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the common ancestor of the head and base ref at the time when the pull request was created. Consequently, the merge base used for the comparison might be different.

To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git

For example:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

For more information on which URL to use, see About remote repositories.
Troubleshooting: Remote origin already exists
This error means you've tried to add a remote with a name that already exists in your local repository.
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
> fatal: remote origin already exists.

To fix this, you can:

Use a different name for the new remote.
Rename the existing remote repository before you add the new remote. For more information, see Renaming a remote repository below.
Delete the existing remote repository before you add the new remote. For more information, see Removing a remote repository below.

Changing a remote repository's URL
The git remote set-url command changes an existing remote repository URL.
Tip

For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see About remote repositories.

The git remote set-url command takes two arguments:


An existing remote name. For example, origin or upstream are two common choices.


A new URL for the remote. For example:

If you're updating to use HTTPS, your URL might look like:

https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git


If you're updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:

git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git



Switching remote URLs from SSH to HTTPS


Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.


Change the current working directory to your local project.


List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.
$ git remote -v
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)



Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the git remote set-url command.
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git



Verify that the remote URL has changed.
$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)



The next time you git fetch, git pull, or git push to the remote repository, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like Git Credential Manager. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens.
You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub username and personal access token every time it talks to GitHub.
Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH


Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.


Change the current working directory to your local project.


List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)



Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the git remote set-url command.
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git



Verify that the remote URL has changed.
$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)



Troubleshooting: No such remote '[name]'
This error means that the remote you tried to change doesn't exist:
$ git remote set-url sofake https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
> fatal: No such remote 'sofake'

Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.
Renaming a remote repository
Use the git remote rename command to rename an existing remote.
The git remote rename command takes two arguments:

An existing remote name, for example, origin
A new name for the remote, for example, destination

Example of renaming a remote repository
These examples assume you're cloning using HTTPS, which is recommended.
$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rename origin destination
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'destination'

$ git remote -v
# Verify remote's new name
> destination  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

Troubleshooting: Could not rename config section 'remote.[old name]' to 'remote.[new name]'
This error means that the old remote name you typed doesn't exist.
You can check which remotes currently exist with the git remote -v command:
$ git remote -v
# View existing remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

Troubleshooting: Remote [new name] already exists
This error means that the remote name you want to use already exists. To solve this, either use a different remote name, or rename the original remote.
Removing a remote repository
Use the git remote rm command to remove a remote URL from your repository.
The git remote rm command takes one argument:

A remote name, for example, destination

Removing the remote URL from your repository only unlinks the local and remote repositories. It does not delete the remote repository.
Example of removing a remote repository
These examples assume you're cloning using HTTPS, which is recommended.
$ git remote -v
# View current remotes
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

$ git remote rm destination
# Remove remote
$ git remote -v
# Verify it's gone
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

Note

git remote rm does not delete the remote repository from the server. It simply removes the remote and its references from your local repository.

Troubleshooting: Could not remove config section 'remote.[name]'
This error means that the remote you tried to delete doesn't exist:
$ git remote rm sofake
> error: Could not remove config section 'remote.sofake'

Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.

GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy statement and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.
GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Dispute resolution process
In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, GitHub commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact GitHub at: dpo[at]github[dot]com.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://go.adr.org/dpf_irm.html for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution are provided at no cost to you.
An individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms.

Government Enforcement
GitHub is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 45), an organization's failure to abide by commitments to implement the DPF Principles may be challenged as deceptive by the FTC. The FTC has the power to prohibit such misrepresentations through administrative orders or by seeking court orders.
Security and Retention
GitHub uses appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your Personal Data. We’ll retain your Personal Data as long as your account is active and as needed to fulfill contractual obligations, comply with legal requirements, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. The retention duration depends on the purpose of data collection and any legal obligations.

Our use of cookies and tracking technologies
Cookies and tracking technologies
GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about cookies on GitHub that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.
For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.
Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.
The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see GitHub General Privacy Statement.
What are cookies and similar technologies?
We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.
Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.
Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.
We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.
How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?
The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.
We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.
The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

























PurposeDescriptionRequired CookiesGitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work.AnalyticsWe allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising.Social MediaGitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub.AdvertisingIn addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history.
What are your cookie choices and controls?
You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:


Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages
Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.
Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.


Generally for all websites
You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:



If your browser sends a Do Not Track (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as Privacy Badger, non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as uBlock Origin, non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy
Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
United States: NAI and DAA
Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.
US State Specific Information
This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”
Privacy Rights
These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:

Right to Knowledge and Correction: You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we’ve collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information. You can exercise this right by contacting us. You can also access and edit basic account information in your settings.
Right to Know Data Recipients: We share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see “Sharing Your Information” below.
Right to request Deletion: You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.
Right to a Timely Response: You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.
Non-Discrimination: We will not hold it against you when you exercise any of your rights. On the contrary, we encourage you to review your privacy settings closely and contact us with any questions.

The GitHub Terms of Service
Effective date: November 16, 2020
A. Definitions
Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.

An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.
"Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).
The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as electronjs.org. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

B. Account Terms
Short version: Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.
1. Account Controls


Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.


Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.


2. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
3. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our Export Controls policy.

4. Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the GitHub Support portal if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

5. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.
If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.
C. Acceptable Use
Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.
You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.
D. User-Generated Content
Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.
1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
2. GitHub May Remove Content
We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies. User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.
3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.
Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.
4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.
5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).
If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.
6. Contributions Under Repository License
Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.
7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.
To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
E. Private Repositories
Short version: We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.
1. Control of Private Repositories
Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.
2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories
GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
3. Access
GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.
You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.
GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.
F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.
We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.
G. Intellectual Property Notice
Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.
1. GitHub's Rights to Content
GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.
2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos
If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.
3. License to GitHub Policies
This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.
H. API Terms
Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.
Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.
You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.
You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement.
GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.
I. GitHub Additional Product Terms
Short version: You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.
Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.
J. Beta Previews
Short version: Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.
1. Subject to Change
Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.
2. Confidentiality
As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.
Confidentiality Obligations. You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).
Exceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.
3. Feedback
We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.
K. Payment
Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.
1. Pricing
Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.
2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.
Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:

Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.
Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.

Collaborative working, one of GitHub’s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.
About Git
Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files. Git is particularly useful when you and a group of people are all making changes to the same files at the same time.
Typically, to do this in a Git-based workflow, you would:

Create a branch off from the main copy of files that you (and your collaborators) are working on.
Make edits to the files independently and safely on your own personal branch.
Let Git intelligently merge your specific changes back into the main copy of files, so that your changes don't impact other people's updates.
Let Git keep track of your and other people's changes, so you all stay working on the most up-to-date version of the project.

To try using Git yourself, see Getting started with Git.
How do Git and GitHub work together?
When you upload files to GitHub, you'll store them in a "Git repository." This means that when you make changes (or "commits") to your files in GitHub, Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.
There are plenty of Git-related actions that you can complete on GitHub directly in your browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.
However, most people work on their files locally (on their own computer), then continually sync these local changes—and all the related Git data—with the central "remote" repository on GitHub. There are plenty of tools that you can use to do this, such as GitHub Desktop.
Once you start to collaborate with others and all need to work on the same repository at the same time, you’ll continually:

Pull all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on GitHub.
Push back your own changes to the same remote repository on GitHub.

Git figures out how to intelligently merge this flow of changes, and GitHub helps you manage the flow through features such as "pull requests."
Where do I start?
If you're new to GitHub, and unfamiliar with Git, we recommend working through the articles in the Start your journey category. The articles focus on tasks you can complete directly in your browser on GitHub and will help you to:

Create an account on GitHub.
Learn the "GitHub Flow", and the key principles of collaborative working (branches, commits, pull requests, merges).
Personalise your profile to share your interests and skills.
Explore GitHub to find inspiration for your own projects and connect with others.
Learn how to download interesting code for your own use.
Learn how to upload something you're working on to a GitHub repository.

To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account and verify your email address.
Every person who uses GitHub signs in to a user account. Your user account is your identity on GitHub and has a username and profile. For example, see @octocat's profile.
Later, you can explore the different types of accounts that GitHub offers, and decide if you need a billing plan. For more information, see Types of GitHub accounts and GitHub’s plans.
Note that the steps in this article don't apply to Enterprise Managed Users. If your GitHub account has been created for you by your company, you can skip this article and continue to Hello World.
Signing up for a new personal account

Navigate to https://github.com/.
Click Sign up.
Follow the prompts to create your personal account.

During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address. Without a verified email address, you won't be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.
Some enterprises create managed user accounts for their users. You can't sign up for a personal account with an email address that's already verified for a managed user account.
If you're having problems verifying your email address, there are some troubleshooting steps you can take. For more information, see Verifying your email address.
Next steps

Now that you've created your personal account, we'll start to explore the basics of GitHub. In the next tutorial, Hello World, you'll learn about repositories and how to create one, and you'll be introduced to concepts such as branching, commits, and pull requests.
We strongly recommend that you configure 2FA for your account. 2FA is an extra layer of security that can help keep your account secure. For more information, see Configuring two-factor authentication.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
In this quickstart guide, you will:

Create and use a repository.
Start and manage a new branch.
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits.
Open and merge a pull request.

Prerequisites


You must have a GitHub account. For more information, see Creating an account on GitHub.


You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on).


Step 1: Create a repository
The first thing we'll do is create a repository. You can think of a repository as a folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders. A repository usually groups together items that belong to the same "project" or thing you're working on.
Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in Markdown, which is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text. We'll learn more about Markdown in the next tutorial, Setting up your profile.
GitHub lets you add a README file at the same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them now.
Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.


In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.



In the "Repository name" box, type hello-world.


In the "Description" box, type a short description. For example, type "This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."


Select whether your repository will be Public or Private.


Select Add a README file.


Click Create repository.


Step 2: Create a branch
Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of main in your repository.
Branching is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
This diagram shows:

The main branch
A new branch called feature
The journey that feature takes through stages for "Commit changes," "Submit pull request," and "Discuss proposed changes" before it's merged into main


Creating a branch


Click the Code tab of your hello-world repository.


Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says main.



Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the text box.


Click Create branch: readme-edits from main.



Now you have two branches, main and readme-edits. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new readme-edits branch.
Step 3: Make and commit changes
When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch, which is a copy of main.
You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Under the readme-edits branch you created, click the README.md file.
To edit the file, click .
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
Click Commit changes.
In the "Commit changes" box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes.

These changes will be made only to the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from main.
Step 4: Open a pull request
Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.
Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
In this step, you'll open a pull request in your own repository and then merge it yourself. It's a great way to practice the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.


Click the Pull requests tab of your hello-world repository.


Click New pull request.


In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main (the original).


Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.



Click Create pull request.


Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.


Click Create pull request.


Reviewing a pull request
When you start collaborating with others, this is the time you'd ask for their review. This allows your collaborators to comment on, or propose changes to, your pull request before you merge the changes into the main branch.
We won't cover reviewing pull requests in this tutorial, but if you're interested in learning more, see About pull request reviews. Alternatively, try the GitHub Skills "Reviewing pull requests" course.
Step 5: Merge your pull request
In this final step, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch. After you merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main.
Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.
In this walk-through, you should not have any conflicts, so you are ready to merge your branch into the main branch.

At the bottom of the pull request, click Merge pull request to merge the changes into main.
Click Confirm merge. You will receive a message that the request was successfully merged and the request was closed.
Click Delete branch. Now that your pull request is merged and your changes are on main, you can safely delete the readme-edits branch. If you want to make more changes to your project, you can always create a new branch and repeat this process.
Click back to the Code tab of your hello-world repository to see your published changes on main.

Your profile page on GitHub is a place where people can find out more about you. You can use your profile to:

Share your interests and skills.
Showcase your projects and contributions.
Express your identity and show the GitHub community who you are.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to personalize your profile by adding a profile picture, bio, and a profile README.
You'll also learn the basics of Markdown syntax, which is what you'll use to format any writing you do on GitHub.
Prerequisites

You must have a GitHub account. For more information, see Creating an account on GitHub.

Adding a profile picture and bio
First, we'll add a picture to your profile. Your profile picture helps identify you across GitHub.
Adding a profile picture


In the upper-right corner of any page, click your existing profile avatar, then, from the dropdown menu, click Settings.


Under "Profile Picture", select  Edit, then click Upload a photo....



Select an image, then click Upload.


Crop your picture.


Click Set new profile picture.


Next, we'll add some basic information about yourself to share with other GitHub users. This information will display below your profile picture on your profile page.
Adding a bio


On your profile page, under your profile picture, click Edit profile.


Under "Bio", write one or two sentences about yourself, such as who you are and what you do.
Note

Keep the bio short; we'll add a longer description of your interests in your profile README in the section below.



To add an emoji to your bio, visit Emoji cheat sheet and copy and paste an emoji into the "Bio" dialog box.


Optionally, add your preferred pronouns, workplace, location and timezone, and any links to your personal website and social accounts. Your pronouns will only be visible to users that are signed in to GitHub.


Click Save.


Adding a profile README
Next, we'll create a special repository and README file that will be displayed directly on your profile page.
Your profile README contains information such as your interests, skills, and background, and it can be a great way to introduce yourself to other people on GitHub and showcase your work.
As we learned in the Hello World tutorial, README.md files are written using Markdown syntax (note the .md file extension), which is just a way to format plain text.
In the following steps, we'll create and edit your profile README.
Step 1: Create a new repository for your profile README


In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.



Under "Repository name", type a repository name that matches your GitHub username. For example, if your username is "octocat", the repository name must be "octocat."


Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your repository. For example, "My personal repository."


Select Public.


Select Initialize this repository with a README.


Click Create repository.


Step 2: Edit the README.md file


Click the  next to your profile README.



In the "Edit" view, you'll see some pre-populated text to get you started. On line 1, delete the text that says ### Hi there and type # About me.

In Markdown syntax, ### renders the plain text as a small ("third-level") heading, while ## or # renders a second- and first-level heading respectively.



Toggle to "Preview" to see how the plain text now renders. You should see the new text displayed as a much larger heading.


Toggle back to the "Edit" view.


Delete line 3 and line 16.

This HTML syntax (e.g. <!--) is keeping the other lines hidden when you toggle to "Preview".



Complete some of the prompts on lines 8 to 15, and delete any lines you don't want. For example, add your interests, skills, hobbies, or a fun fact about yourself.


Now, toggle to "Preview". You should see your completed prompts render as a bulleted list.


Toggle back to "Edit" and remove any other lines of text that you don't want displayed on your profile.


Keep customizing and editing your profile README.

Use the Emoji cheat sheet to add emojis.
Use the Markdown cheat sheet to experiment with additional Markdown formatting.



Step 3: Publish your changes to your profile

When you're happy with how your profile README looks in "Preview", and you're ready to publish it, click Commit changes...
In the open dialog box, simply click again Commit changes.
Navigate back to your profile page. You will see your new profile README displayed on your profile.

This tutorial will show you how to upload a group of files to a GitHub repository.
Uploading your files to a GitHub repository lets you:

Apply version control when you make edits to the files, so your project's history is protected and manageable.
Back up your work, because your files are now stored in the cloud.
Pin the repository to your personal profile, so that others can see your work.
Share and discuss your work with others, either publicly or privately.

If you're already familiar with Git, and you're looking for information on how to upload a locally-stored Git repository to GitHub, see Adding locally hosted code to GitHub.
Prerequisites

You must have a GitHub account. For more information, see Creating an account on GitHub.
You should have a group of files you'd like to upload.

Step 1: Create a new repository for your project
It's a good idea to create a new repository for each individual project you're working on. If you're writing a software project, grouping all the related files in a new repository makes it easier to maintain and manage the codebase over time.


In the upper-right corner of any page, select , then click New repository.



In the "Repository name" box, type a name for your project. For example, type "my-first-project."


In the "Description" box, type a short description. For example, type "This is my first project on GitHub."


Select whether your repository will be Public or Private. Select "Public" if you want others to be able to see your project.


Select Add a README file. You will edit this file in a later step.


Click Create repository.


Step 2: Upload files to your project's repository
So far, you should only see one file listed in the repository, the README.md file you created when you initialized the repository. Now, we'll upload some of your own files.

To the right of the page, select the Add file dropdown menu.
From the dropdown menu, click Upload files.
On your computer, open the folder containing your work, then drag and drop all files and folders into the browser.
At the bottom of the page, under "Commit changes", select "Commit directly to the main branch, then click Commit changes.

Step 3: Edit the README file for your project's repository
Your repository's README file is typically the first item someone will see when visiting your repository. It usually contains information on what your project is about and why your project is useful.
As we learned in the Hello World tutorial, the README file (README.md) is written in Markdown syntax. Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.
In this step, we'll edit your project's README.md using Markdown so that it includes some basic information about your project.


From the list of files, click README.md to view the file.


In the upper right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.

You will see that some information about your project has been pre-filled for you. For example, you should see the repository name and repository description you completed in Step 1 displayed on line 1 and line 2.



Delete the existing text apart from #, then type a proper title for your project.

Example: # About my first project on GitHub.



Next, add some information about your project, such as a description of the project's purpose or its main features.
Note

If you're not sure what to write, take a look at other repositories on GitHub to see how other people describe their projects.
To apply more sophisticated formatting, such as adding images, links, and footnotes, see Basic writing and formatting syntax.



Above the new content, click Preview.



Take a look at how the file will render once we save our changes, then toggle back to "Edit".


Continue to edit and preview the text until you're happy with the content of your README.


In the top right, click Commit changes.


In the dialog box that opens, a commit message has been pre-filled for you ("Update README.md") and, by default, the option to "Commit directly to the main branch" has been selected. Leave these options as they are and go ahead and click Commit changes.


Conclusion
You have now created a new repository, uploaded some files to it, and added a project README.
If you set your repository visibility to "Public," the repository will be displayed on your personal profile and you can share the URL of your repository with others.
As you add, edit or delete files directly in the browser on GitHub, GitHub will track these changes ("commits"), so you can start to manage your project's history and evolution.
When making changes, remember that you can create a new branch from the main branch of your repository, so that you can experiment without affecting the main copy of files. Then, when you're happy with a set of a changes, open a pull request to merge the changes into your main branch. For a reminder of how to do this, see Hello World.
Next steps


Most people want to keep working on their files locally (i.e. on their own computer), and then continually sync these locally-made changes with this "remote" (in the cloud) repository on GitHub. There are plenty of tools that let you do this, such as GitHub Desktop. To get started, you'd need to:

Install GitHub Desktop. For more information, see Getting started with GitHub Desktop.
Clone the remote repository, so you have a copy of it on your own computer. For more information, see Cloning and forking repositories from GitHub Desktop.
Continually sync your local changes with this remote repository. For more information, see Syncing your branch in GitHub Desktop.



To learn more about other tools available for working with repositories hosted on GitHub, see Connecting to GitHub.
