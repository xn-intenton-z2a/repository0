# http‑pipeline‑optimizer

**http‑pipeline‑optimizer** is designed to optimize HTTP request pipelines. It can batch requests together, merge responses, and minimize overall latency for high‑volume API calls.

## Installation

  ```bash
    npm install http-pipeline-optimizer
    ```

## Usage

  ```javascript
    const { optimizePipeline } = require('http-pipeline-optimizer');

    const requests = [
    { url: 'https://api.example.com/data1', method: 'GET' },
    { url: 'https://api.example.com/data2', method: 'GET' },
    ];

    optimizePipeline(requests, { timeout: 5000 })
    .then(responses => {
      responses.forEach(response => console.log(response.data));
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Pipeline error:', error);
    });
    ```

## API Reference

- **optimizePipeline(requests: Request[], options?: Object): Promise\<Response[]>**
Batches and executes the provided HTTP requests with the specified options.

## When & For Whom

Particularly useful for microservices or API gateways that need to reduce the latency of multiple HTTP calls by combining them intelligently.
