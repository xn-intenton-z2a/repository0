# event‑stream‑aggregator

**event‑stream‑aggregator** helps you combine multiple asynchronous event streams into one unified stream. It supports configurable time‑window aggregation, deduplication, and custom merging logic.

## Installation

  ```bash
    npm install event-stream-aggregator
    ```

## Usage

  ```javascript
    const { aggregateStreams } = require('event-stream-aggregator');

    // Assume stream1 and stream2 are readable event streams (for example, from sensors or websockets)
    const aggregatedStream = aggregateStreams([stream1, stream2], {
      timeWindow: 1000, // aggregate events every second
      deduplicate: true,
    });

    aggregatedStream.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log('Aggregated event:', data);
    });
    ```

## API Reference
