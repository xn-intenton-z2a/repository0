# async‑fs‑lock

**async‑fs‑lock** is a lightweight library that provides robust asynchronous file locking for Node.js. It allows multiple processes or asynchronous tasks to safely access and modify files without interfering with one another.

## Installation

  ```bash
npm install async-fs-lock
```

## Usage

  ```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const { acquireLock, releaseLock } = require('async-fs-lock');

async function updateFile(filePath, newContent) {
  const lock = await acquireLock(filePath);
  try {
    const currentContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    // ... perform modifications using currentContent ...
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, newContent, 'utf8');
  } finally {
    await releaseLock(lock);
  }
}

updateFile('./data/config.json', '{"updated": true}');
```

## API Reference

- **acquireLock(filePath: string): Promise\<Lock>**
  Acquires a lock on the given file.
  - **releaseLock(lock: Lock): Promise\<void>**
    Releases a previously acquired lock.

    ### When & For Whom

    This library is especially useful for multi‑process Node.js applications or scripts that need to perform safe file operations in a concurrent environment.
