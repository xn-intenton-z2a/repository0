Generated issue 2285 for feature "hello-world" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2285

title:

Implement HELLO_WORLD CLI: default, diagnostics, and serve modes

And description:

## Summary

Add full support for the HELLO_WORLD feature by enhancing the CLI to print “Hello World” in default mode, a diagnostics report in diagnostics mode, and start an HTTP server that responds with “Hello World” in serve mode. Update tests and documentation accordingly.

## Changes

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Default invocation (no flags): print exactly `Hello World` to stdout.
   - `--diagnostics` flag: print `Hello World`, then log `Node version: <process.version>`, `Platform: <process.platform>`, and `Args: <JSON.stringify(remainingArgs)>`.
   - `--serve` flag: spin up an HTTP server on port `3000` that responds to `GET /` with status `200` and body `Hello World`.
   - Preserve existing behavior when called programmatically via `main(args)`.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add unit tests for default mode: capture stdout and verify exactly `Hello World`.
   - Diagnostics mode test: override `process.argv`, capture stdout, and assert lines include `Hello World`, correct `Node version:`, `Platform:`, and passed args.
   - Serve mode test: launch the server programmatically, send an HTTP GET to `http://localhost:3000/`, and verify response status is `200` and body is `Hello World`. Ensure server is closed after test.

3. **README.md**
   - Document new CLI commands:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     npm run diagnostics
     npm run serve
     ```  
   - Provide expected outputs for each mode.
   - Explain how to run tests: `npm test`.

## Verification

1. Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass.
2. Run `npm run start` and confirm console output is exactly:
   ```txt
   Hello World
   ```
3. Run `npm run diagnostics` and confirm output includes:
   ```txt
   Hello World
   Node version: vXX.X.X
   Platform: <your-platform>
   Args: []
   ```
4. Start the server with `npm run serve` and visit `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser or via `curl`; confirm response is:
   ```txt
   Hello World
   ```
