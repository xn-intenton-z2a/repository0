title:

Implement fetch subcommand for PUBLIC_DATA_CRAWLER CLI

And description:

We need to build out the `PUBLIC_DATA_CRAWLER` feature by adding a `fetch` subcommand to our main CLI. This change will allow users to retrieve data from a public API endpoint, validate it with Zod, transform it into a nodes/edges graph format, and output structured JSON to stdout or a file.

Scope of Changes:

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Change `main` to accept an optional `args` parameter (defaulting to `process.argv.slice(2)`) and mark it `async`.
   - Detect when the first argument is `fetch` and parse the `--endpoint <url>` and `--output <file>` flags.
   - Use the global `fetch` API to GET the JSON payload from the specified endpoint (default: `https://api.example.com/data`).
   - Define a Zod schema to validate that the response is an array of items, each with:
     ```js
     {
       id: number,
       name: string,
       relations: number[]
     }
     ```
   - Transform the validated payload into a graph representation:
     ```json
     {
       "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "Name1" }, ... ],
       "edges": [ { "source": 1, "target": 2 }, ... ]
     }
     ```
   - If `--output` is provided, write the stringified JSON to that file (using `fs.writeFileSync`); otherwise, `console.log` the JSON to stdout.
   - On network or validation errors, log the error to `console.error` and throw an exception (which results in a nonzero exit code).

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add a new `describe('fetch subcommand', ...)` block.
   - Mock `global.fetch` via `vi.stubGlobal('fetch', ...)` to simulate:
     - A successful GET returning a sample payload.
     - A failing GET (e.g. non-OK response or invalid JSON) that triggers an error path.
   - Spy on `console.log` and, for the file output scenario, stub `fs.writeFileSync` to collect the output.
   - Verify that the CLI produces the correct JSON structure in stdout or writes it to the file, and that error conditions are handled (throws).

3. **README.md**
   - Add a **Fetch Subcommand** section under CLI Usage.
   - Document the `--endpoint` and `--output` flags, default values, and show example invocations:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- fetch
     npm run start -- fetch --endpoint https://api.example.com/data --output out.json
     ```

Verification Steps:

- Run `npm test` to ensure all existing and new tests pass.
- Run `npm run start -- fetch` and confirm that JSON is printed to stdout in the expected graph format.
- Run `npm run start -- fetch --output out.json` and open `out.json` to confirm the correct content.

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/ with enhanced description:

Title: Implement fetch subcommand for PUBLIC_DATA_CRAWLER CLI

Description:
Implement a new `fetch` subcommand to the main CLI to retrieve data from a public API, validate it with Zod, transform it into a nodes/edges graph format, and output structured JSON to stdout or a file.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Default behavior:
   - Given no flags, running `npm run start -- fetch` fetches from `https://api.example.com/data`.
   - The output is valid JSON with properties:
     ```json
     {
       "nodes": [ { "id": number, "label": string }, ... ],
       "edges": [ { "source": number, "target": number }, ... ]
     }
     ```
   - Output is sent to stdout via `console.log`.

2. Custom endpoint:
   - Given `--endpoint <url>`, the CLI fetches from the specified URL.
   - The same JSON schema is produced.

3. File output:
   - Given `--output <file>`, the CLI writes the stringified JSON to the given file path using `fs.writeFileSync`.
   - No console output besides error messages.

4. Error handling:
   - Network errors or non-OK responses cause the command to exit with a nonzero code and log the error to `console.error`.
   - Validation failures against the Zod schema throw an exception, exit nonzero, and log the validation error.

5. Tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js`:
   - Mock `global.fetch` to return a successful payload, and assert `console.log` is called with the expected JSON.
   - Mock `global.fetch` to return invalid data, and assert an error is thrown and logged.
   - Stub `fs.writeFileSync` and run with `--output`, then assert the file is written with the expected JSON.

6. Documentation in `README.md`:
   - Add a **Fetch Subcommand** section under CLI Usage.
   - Describe `--endpoint` and `--output` flags with default values.
   - Provide example invocations:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- fetch
     npm run start -- fetch --endpoint https://api.example.com/data --output out.json
     ```

Verification:
- All existing and new tests pass (`npm test`).
- Manual test executes `npm run start -- fetch` and confirms JSON output.
- Manual test with `--output` writes correct file content.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":6772,"completion_tokens":978,"total_tokens":7750,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":384,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```
