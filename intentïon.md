Activity:

Generated issue 2258 for feature "cli-flags" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2258

title:

Implement CLI flags support (--help, --version) in main script

And description:

# Description

Enhance the main script to accept and process standard CLI flags according to the CLI_FLAGS specification:

1. **--help**: Display a usage message listing available flags, then exit cleanly with code `0`.
2. **--version**: Read the version number from `package.json` and print it to stdout, then exit cleanly with code `0`.
3. **Default behavior**: When no flags or unrecognized flags are provided, maintain existing behavior by logging the provided arguments.

# Changes Required

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Modify the `main` function to accept an optional `args` array (defaulting to `process.argv.slice(2)`).
   - Detect `--help` and `--version` flags:
     - For `--help`, print a usage string explaining supported flags.
     - For `--version`, read and print the version from `package.json`.
   - Ensure that, after handling flags, the process exits cleanly with `process.exit(0)` and does not fall through to logging.
   - Preserve existing behavior of logging `args` when no known flags are present.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add or update tests to cover:
     - Invoking `main` directly with `["--help"]` prints the expected help text.
     - Invoking `main` with `["--version"]` prints the package version (matching `package.json`).
     - Default invocation without known flags continues to log the provided arguments and does not throw.
   - Use `vitest` spies/mocks on `console.log` and stub `process.exit` to verify exit codes without terminating the test process.

3. **README.md**
   - Document the new CLI flags in the "Running the Demo" section:
     - Show example commands and outputs for `npm run start -- --help` and `npm run start -- --version`.

# Verification

1. Run the existing tests: `npm test` (all tests should pass, including new flag tests).
2. Manually test:
   - `node src/lib/main.js --help` should output a usage message and exit with code 0.
   - `node src/lib/main.js --version` should output the version (e.g., `1.2.0-0`) and exit with code 0.
   - `node src/lib/main.js foo bar` should print `Run with: ["foo","bar"]` as before.

The LLM worker can apply these changes by editing **only** the source file (`src/lib/main.js`), the test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), and the README (`README.md`).
