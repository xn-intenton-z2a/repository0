# Mission Statement

`repository0` is a repository template that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentÃ¯on `agenticâ€‘lib`. Its
primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and provide a basis for further development.
We add features to showcase what we can confidently do with completion calls to an LLM with a 200,000 token limit used
to create and update directory of JS source and test files. The files in `sandbox/` are maintained by the repository's 
workflows and run using the same test suite as the main source file.

We showcase what you can by generating a new feature showing it at work as the output of `npm run start` and with 
feature level tests showing primary flows as well as classic unit tests. 

The mission of the contributors, human or automated, is to show case the workflow capabilities of the repository.

Hello @Antony-at-Polycode ðŸ‘‹

Youâ€™ll see the seed branch created and a trace of this discussion recorded. Let me know once youâ€™re ready to proceed with opening pull requests for sandbox features or any further steps!
