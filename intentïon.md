Maintained feature CLI_PARSER with

Feature spec:

# CLI_PARSER

# Description
Add robust command line argument parsing to the main CLI function. Replace the raw JSON string output with a structured options object parsed from process arguments.

# Flags and Subcommands
1. help prints usage information and exits
2. diagnostics enables diagnostic mode for detailed output
3. serve starts a simple HTTP server on a default port
4. build-intermediate and build-enhanced perform staged build operations
5. refresh reloads configuration and data
6. merge-persist merges data and persists changes to disk

# Implementation
Modify src/lib/main.js to import its existing dependencies and use zod to define a CLI schema for allowed flags and options. Slice process.argv to extract user input, validate against the schema, and produce an options object. When help is requested or validation fails, display usage text and exit with status 0 or nonzero as appropriate. Export a parseArgs function for testing.

# Testing
Extend tests in tests/unit/main.test.js. Add unit tests for parseArgs to confirm correct parsing of each flag and flag combinations. Test that help triggers process exit with code 0 and outputs the usage text.

# Documentation
Update README.md to include a new section on CLI usage and flags. Provide inline examples of running npm run start with each flag and expected behavior without using fenced code blocks.

Generated issue 2295 for feature "cli-parser" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2295

title:

Implement CLI argument parsing with Zod schema

And description:

This issue adds a robust CLI parsing layer to the main entrypoint using Zod. We will: 1. Create and export a parseArgs(args: string[]) function in src/lib/main.js:   - Define a Zod schema for flags: help, diagnostics, serve, buildIntermediate, buildEnhanced, refresh, mergePersist (booleans)   - Validate process.argv.slice(2) against the schema and return a structured options object.   - If `--help` is present or validation fails, print a usage message (detailing available flags and subcommands) to stdout and exit with code 0 (help) or non-zero (error).   - In the `main()` function, call parseArgs and replace the raw JSON console.log with `console.log('Options:', options)`. 2. Update tests in tests/unit/main.test.js:   - Write unit tests for parseArgs covering each flag on its own, multiple flags, and invalid input.   - Test that `--help` prints usage text and exits with code 0 (use Vitestâ€™s `spyOn(process, 'exit')` and `spyOn(console, 'log')`).   - Ensure `main()` delegates to parseArgs without throwing. 3. Update README.md:   - Add a **CLI Usage** section listing available flags (help, diagnostics, serve, build-intermediate, build-enhanced, refresh, merge-persist).   - Include inline examples (without fenced code blocks) showing how to run `npm run start --diagnostics` etc. 4. Ensure package.json dependencies include Zod (already present) and scripts are accurate. 5. Verify: after LLM-generated patch, run `npm test` (unit tests) and `npm run start --help` to see usage. All tests and manual CLI examples should work as expected.
