Generated issue 2285 for feature "hello-world" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2285

title:

Implement HELLO_WORLD CLI: default, diagnostics, and serve modes

And description:

## Summary

Add full support for the HELLO_WORLD feature by enhancing the CLI to print “Hello World” in default mode, a diagnostics report in diagnostics mode, and start an HTTP server that responds with “Hello World” in serve mode. Update tests and documentation accordingly.

## Changes

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Default invocation (no flags): print exactly `Hello World` to stdout.
   - `--diagnostics` flag: print `Hello World`, then log `Node version: <process.version>`, `Platform: <process.platform>`, and `Args: <JSON.stringify(remainingArgs)>`.
   - `--serve` flag: spin up an HTTP server on port `3000` that responds to `GET /` with status `200` and body `Hello World`.
   - Preserve existing behavior when called programmatically via `main(args)`.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add unit tests for default mode: capture stdout and verify exactly `Hello World`.
   - Diagnostics mode test: override `process.argv`, capture stdout, and assert lines include `Hello World`, correct `Node version:`, `Platform:`, and passed args.
   - Serve mode test: launch the server programmatically, send an HTTP GET to `http://localhost:3000/`, and verify response status is `200` and body is `Hello World`. Ensure server is closed after test.

3. **README.md**
   - Document new CLI commands:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     npm run diagnostics
     npm run serve
     ```  
   - Provide expected outputs for each mode.
   - Explain how to run tests: `npm test`.

## Verification

1. Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass.
2. Run `npm run start` and confirm console output is exactly:
   ```txt
   Hello World
   ```
3. Run `npm run diagnostics` and confirm output includes:
   ```txt
   Hello World
   Node version: vXX.X.X
   Platform: <your-platform>
   Args: []
   ```
4. Start the server with `npm run serve` and visit `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser or via `curl`; confirm response is:
   ```txt
   Hello World
   ```

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":6295,"completion_tokens":1394,"total_tokens":7689,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":832,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/ with enhanced description:

# Implement HELLO_WORLD CLI: default, diagnostics, and serve modes

## Summary
Add full support for the HELLO_WORLD feature by enhancing the CLI to:

1. Default mode (no flags): print exactly `Hello World` to stdout and exit with code 0.
2. Diagnostics mode (`--diagnostics` flag): print `Hello World` on the first line, then output three additional lines:
   - `Node version: <process.version>`
   - `Platform: <process.platform>`
   - `Args: <JSON.stringify(remainingArgs)>`
   Exit with code 0.
3. Serve mode (`--serve` flag): start an HTTP server on port 3000 that responds to `GET /` with status code 200 and body `Hello World`.  The server should close gracefully after being programmatically stopped.
4. Preserve and test existing behavior when `main(args)` is called directly.

## Testable Acceptance Criteria

1. **Default Mode**
   - Given no flags, when running `node src/lib/main.js`, then stdout is exactly:
     ```txt
     Hello World
     ``` 
   - Process should exit with code 0.

2. **Diagnostics Mode**
   - Given `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics arg1 arg2`, then stdout includes exactly:
     ```txt
     Hello World
     Node version: vX.Y.Z
     Platform: <current-platform>
     Args: ["arg1","arg2"]
     ```
   - Lines must appear in this order, match JSON formatting for remaining args, and exit code is 0.

3. **Serve Mode**
   - Given `node src/lib/main.js --serve`, the process listens on port 3000.
   - When sending an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:3000/`, the response status is `200` and body is exactly `Hello World`.
   - The server can be programmatically stopped (e.g., by calling a returned `close()` function) without errors.

4. **Programmatic API**
   - Calling `main(args)` directly should not throw, and should respect flags in `args` as if passed on the CLI.

5. **Tests and Documentation**
   - Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to cover default, diagnostics, serve modes, and programmatic invocation with appropriate assertions.
   - Update `README.md` to include usage examples for `npm run start`, `npm run diagnostics`, and `npm run serve`, and show expected outputs.

## Verification Steps

1. Run `npm test` to ensure all new and existing tests pass.
2. Manually verify:
   - `npm run start` prints `Hello World`.
   - `npm run diagnostics` prints the four lines described above.
   - `npm run serve` starts the server, and `curl http://localhost:3000/` returns `Hello World` with status 200.
3. Confirm `main(args)` behaves identically when invoked from another module.

 });\n\n// New [docs/CLI.md]:\n# Hello World CLI

The `repository0` command-line tool supports three modes: default, diagnostics, and serve.

## Default Mode

Usage:
```bash
npm run start
# or
node src/lib/main.js
```

Output:
```
Hello World
```

---

## Diagnostics Mode

Usage:
```bash
npm run diagnostics
# or
node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics [args...]
```

Example output:
```
Hello World
Node version: vX.Y.Z
Platform: <your-platform>
Args: ["arg1","arg2"]
```

---

## Serve Mode

Usage:
```bash
npm run serve
# or
node src/lib/main.js --serve
```

This starts an HTTP server on port `3000`. Send an HTTP GET request to `/`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Hello World
```

The server can be stopped programmatically by calling the returned server’s `close()` method.

---

## Programmatic Usage

You can import and call `main(args)` directly in your application:

```js
import { main } from "./src/lib/main.js";

// Start the server
const server = main(["--serve"]);
// ...
// Stop the server when done
server.close();
```
```

mainOutput:
```log

```

Generated issue 2287 for feature "no-features-refer-to-mission" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2287

title:

Add --mission CLI option to display project mission

And description:

## Summary

Introduce a new `--mission` flag in the CLI entrypoint to surface the repository’s mission directly from the `MISSION.md` file. This ensures features are explicitly tied back to the mission and allows users to review the project goal on demand.

## Changes

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Parse for a new `--mission` argument in the `main(args)` function.
   - When `--mission` is present, read and print the contents of `MISSION.md` to stdout (line-by-line).
   - Short-circuit other modes if `--mission` is provided.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add a unit test for `main(["--mission"])`:
     - Mock the file system read of `MISSION.md` (e.g., using `vi.mock('fs', ...)`).
     - Assert that `console.log` is called with each line of the mocked mission text.

3. **README.md**
   - Document the new `npm run mission` script and `--mission` flag usage under the CLI section, including an example invocation and expected output.

4. **package.json**
   - Add a new npm script:
     ```json
     "mission": "node src/lib/main.js --mission"
     ```

## Verification

1. Run `npm run mission` and confirm the full content of `MISSION.md` is printed to the console.
2. Execute `npm test` and ensure the new mission flag test passes without affecting existing tests.
3. Verify that other CLI modes (`start`, `diagnostics`, `serve`) continue to work as before.
