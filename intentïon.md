Create a CLI app that depicts emotion using facial expressions using ascii art.
This will be the emotion communication mechanism for an AI.
## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-22T00:38:38.926Z

Maintained feature EMOTIVE_FACE.

Feature spec:

# Description

The CLI now supports rendering facial expressions as ASCII art based on an emotion input.

# Goals

Provide a simple interface for AI to communicate emotion through ASCII faces.

# CLI Interface

The main script accepts an --emotion or -e option with values: happy, sad, angry, neutral.
Printing the corresponding ASCII face to stdout.
If no emotion provided, defaults to neutral.

# Implementation

Extend src/lib/main.js to parse arguments, map emotion to ASCII templates, and output the selected face.
Include a mapping object for emotion to ASCII strings. Keep code lightweight.

# Testing

Add unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js that invoke main with various emotion flags and verify correct ASCII art output. Cover all supported emotions and default behavior.

# Documentation

Update README.md to show usage: npm run start -- --emotion happy
Include examples of output for each emotion.

Generated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2187 with title:

Implement EMOTIVE_FACE CLI Support for Emotion-Specific ASCII Art

And description:

We need to extend the CLI to support the `--emotion` (or `-e`) option and render corresponding ASCII faces instead of the current placeholder output. This change will bring the `EMOTIVE_FACE` feature to life by mapping each emotion to its ASCII template and defaulting to `neutral` when no emotion is provided.

**Scope of work (modify only these files):**
- `src/lib/main.js`
- `tests/unit/main.test.js`
- `README.md`

**Tasks:**
1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Remove the placeholder `console.log('Run with: ...')`.
   - Add a mapping object for the emotions:
     ```js
     const faces = {
       happy: '(^_^)',
       sad: '(T_T)',
       angry: '(>_<)',
       neutral: '(-_-)'
     };
     ```
   - Parse `process.argv` (or the passed-in `args`) to look for `--emotion` or `-e` and read the next value.
   - Default to `neutral` if no valid emotion is passed.
   - Output the chosen ASCII face to stdout via `console.log`.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Remove the generic termination test and replace it with unit tests that spy on `console.log`:
     - Verify that `main(["--emotion", "happy"])` logs `(^_^)`.
     - Repeat for `sad`, `angry`, and default behavior (e.g., `main([])` logs `(-_-)`).
   - Ensure tests cover both `--emotion` and `-e` shorthand.

3. **README.md**
   - Update the Usage section to document the new `--emotion` / `-e` option.
   - Provide example commands and their outputs, for example:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- --emotion happy
     # Outputs: (^_^)
     ```
   - Note the default (no flag) behavior.

**Verification:**
- Run `npm test` and confirm all new unit tests pass.
- Run `npm run start -- --emotion sad` (and other emotions) to see the correct ASCII face in the console.

This implementation will fulfill the goals in `features/EMOTIVE_FACE.md` and deliver the primary user value of expressive ASCII faces in the CLI.

LLM API Usage:

```json
{"prompt_tokens":5866,"completion_tokens":1854,"total_tokens":7720,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1280,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}

## Issue to enhanced Issue at 2025-05-22T00:40:21.182Z

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/ with enhanced description:

Title: Implement EMOTIVE_FACE CLI Support for Emotion-Specific ASCII Art

Description:
Extend the CLI to support an `--emotion` (or `-e`) option that renders an ASCII face corresponding to the requested emotion. If no emotion option is provided or an invalid value is passed, the CLI defaults to `neutral`.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. When the user runs:
   ```bash
   npm run start -- --emotion happy
   ```
   the CLI outputs exactly:
   ```
   (^_^)
   ```
2. When the user runs:
   ```bash
   npm run start -- -e sad
   ```
   the CLI outputs exactly:
   ```
   (T_T)
   ```
3. When the user runs without emotion flags:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   the CLI outputs exactly:
   ```
   (-_-)
   ```
4. When the user passes an unsupported emotion:
   ```bash
   npm run start -- --emotion excited
   ```
   the CLI outputs exactly:
   ```bash
   Error: Unsupported emotion 'excited'. Supported emotions are: happy, sad, angry, neutral.
   ```
   and exits with a non-zero status code.
5. Unit tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js`:
   - Spy on `console.log` and verify logs for `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, and default (no args).
   - Verify shorthand flag `-e` behaves identically to `--emotion`.
   - Verify unsupported emotion yields an error log and throws or exits with an error.
6. Update `README.md`:
   - Document the `--emotion`/`-e` option in the Usage section.
   - Include example commands with expected outputs for each supported emotion and for default behavior.

Scope (modify only these files):
- `src/lib/main.js`
- `tests/unit/main.test.js`
- `README.md`

LLM API Usage:

```json
{"prompt_tokens":6166,"completion_tokens":680,"total_tokens":6846,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":192,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
