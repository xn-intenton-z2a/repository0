Activity:

Generated issue 2246 for feature "crawl-url" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2246

title:

Add --crawl CLI option to extract JSON-LD from web pages

And description:

### Summary

Implement a new `--crawl` command-line flag to fetch a target URL, parse embedded JSON-LD `<script>` blocks, and emit them as a JSON array to stdout. This is the first step toward building our knowledge graph by harvesting structured metadata from public web sources.

### Changes to Apply

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Convert `main` to an `async` function with a default argument (`args = []`).
   - Detect the `--crawl` flag (`args[0] === '--crawl'`) and require a URL argument (`args[1]`).
   - Use the global `fetch` API to retrieve the page text. Handle non-OK responses by logging an error and setting `process.exitCode = 1`.
   - Use a global regex (`/<script\s+type=["']application\/ld\+json["'][^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/gi`) to extract all JSON-LD blocks.
   - Safely parse each block; on parse error, log and set `process.exitCode = 1`.
   - Log the resulting array as a compact JSON string.
   - For non-`--crawl` invocations, preserve existing behavior (logging `Run with: [...]`).
   - Wrap the CLI invocation to call `main(args).catch(...)` so uncaught rejections set `process.exitCode = 1`.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Update imports to include Vitest helpers: `vi`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `afterEach`.
   - Add a new `describe('Crawl URL', ...)` block with two async tests:
     1. **Success case**: Mock `global.fetch` to return HTML containing two `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks. Spy on `console.log` and verify it is called with the parsed JSON array.
     2. **Empty case**: Mock `global.fetch` to return HTML without any JSON-LD scripts. Spy on `console.log` and verify it is called with `[]`.
   - Ensure global mocks are restored.

3. **README.md**
   - Under **CLI Usage** or **Running the Demo**, document the new flag:
     ```bash
     # Crawl a URL to extract JSON-LD structured data
     node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://example.com
     ```

### How to Verify

1. Run `npm test` to confirm all unit tests (including the new crawl tests) pass.
2. Manually verify the CLI:
   ```bash
   node src/lib/main.js --crawl https://example.com
   ```
   - For a known page containing JSON-LD, confirm that an array of objects is printed.
   - For a page without JSON-LD, confirm that `[]` is printed and exit code is `0`.

_No new files should be created. Only modify the existing source file (`src/lib/main.js`), test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), and `README.md`._
