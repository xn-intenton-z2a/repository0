Generated issue 2252 for feature "public-data-crawler" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2252

title:

Implement PUBLIC_DATA_CRAWLER CLI command to fetch and stream JSON from HTTP endpoints

And description:

This issue adds the **PUBLIC_DATA_CRAWLER** feature to the CLI tool, enabling it to fetch structured JSON data from a public HTTP endpoint and stream it to standard output in either JSON or NDJSON format.

Scope of work:

1. **Dependency update**
   - Add `axios` to `package.json` dependencies.

2. **CLI implementation** (`src/lib/main.js`)
   - Parse and validate the following flags from `process.argv`:
     - `--source-url` (required): URL to fetch JSON from.
     - `--timeout` (optional, ms): HTTP request timeout (default 5000).
     - `--format` (optional): output format, either `json` (default) or `ndjson`.
   - Perform an HTTP GET with `axios.get(sourceUrl, { timeout })`.
   - On success:
     - If `format===ndjson`, write each array element or object on its own line as JSON.
     - Otherwise, write the full JSON to stdout.
   - On failure or invalid JSON:
     - Print a clear error to `stderr` and `process.exit(1)`.
   - Ensure `main` can be called as an async function and used by the CLI entrypoint.

3. **Testing** (`tests/unit/main.test.js`)
   - Mock `axios` to simulate:
     - A successful JSON response with an array of records.
     - A failure (network error or non-JSON response).
   - Verify:
     - Correct stdout for both `json` and `ndjson` formats.
     - Non-zero exit code on error and an error message printed to `stderr`.

4. **Documentation** (`README.md`)
   - Add a new **PUBLIC_DATA_CRAWLER** section with:
     - Description of the feature.
     - Usage examples:
       ```bash
       npm run start -- --source-url https://example.com/data.json
       npm run start -- --source-url https://example.com/data.json --timeout 10000 --format ndjson
       ```
     - Explanation of flags.

**Verification**

- Run `npm install` and ensure `axios` is added.
- Execute `npm test` and confirm all unit tests pass.
- Run the CLI manually against a known JSON endpoint and verify:
  - Default JSON output.
  - NDJSON output when using `--format ndjson`.
  - Appropriate error handling when the endpoint is unreachable or returns invalid JSON.
