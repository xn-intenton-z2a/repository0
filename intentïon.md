Create a CLI app that depicts emotion using facial expressions using ascii art.
This will be the emotion communication mechanism for an AI.
## Maintain Feature at 2025-05-22T00:38:38.926Z

Maintained feature EMOTIVE_FACE.

Feature spec:

# Description

The CLI now supports rendering facial expressions as ASCII art based on an emotion input.

# Goals

Provide a simple interface for AI to communicate emotion through ASCII faces.

# CLI Interface

The main script accepts an --emotion or -e option with values: happy, sad, angry, neutral.
Printing the corresponding ASCII face to stdout.
If no emotion provided, defaults to neutral.

# Implementation

Extend src/lib/main.js to parse arguments, map emotion to ASCII templates, and output the selected face.
Include a mapping object for emotion to ASCII strings. Keep code lightweight.

# Testing

Add unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js that invoke main with various emotion flags and verify correct ASCII art output. Cover all supported emotions and default behavior.

# Documentation

Update README.md to show usage: npm run start -- --emotion happy
Include examples of output for each emotion.

## Feature to Issue at 2025-05-22T00:39:46.211Z

Generated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2187 with title:

Implement EMOTIVE_FACE CLI Support for Emotion-Specific ASCII Art

And description:

We need to extend the CLI to support the `--emotion` (or `-e`) option and render corresponding ASCII faces instead of the current placeholder output. This change will bring the `EMOTIVE_FACE` feature to life by mapping each emotion to its ASCII template and defaulting to `neutral` when no emotion is provided.

**Scope of work (modify only these files):**
- `src/lib/main.js`
- `tests/unit/main.test.js`
- `README.md`

**Tasks:**
1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Remove the placeholder `console.log('Run with: ...')`.
   - Add a mapping object for the emotions:
     ```js
     const faces = {
       happy: '(^_^)',
       sad: '(T_T)',
       angry: '(>_<)',
       neutral: '(-_-)'
     };
     ```
   - Parse `process.argv` (or the passed-in `args`) to look for `--emotion` or `-e` and read the next value.
   - Default to `neutral` if no valid emotion is passed.
   - Output the chosen ASCII face to stdout via `console.log`.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Remove the generic termination test and replace it with unit tests that spy on `console.log`:
     - Verify that `main(["--emotion", "happy"])` logs `(^_^)`.
     - Repeat for `sad`, `angry`, and default behavior (e.g., `main([])` logs `(-_-)`).
   - Ensure tests cover both `--emotion` and `-e` shorthand.

3. **README.md**
   - Update the Usage section to document the new `--emotion` / `-e` option.
   - Provide example commands and their outputs, for example:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- --emotion happy
     # Outputs: (^_^)
     ```
   - Note the default (no flag) behavior.

**Verification:**
- Run `npm test` and confirm all new unit tests pass.
- Run `npm run start -- --emotion sad` (and other emotions) to see the correct ASCII face in the console.

This implementation will fulfill the goals in `features/EMOTIVE_FACE.md` and deliver the primary user value of expressive ASCII faces in the CLI.

{"prompt_tokens":5866,"completion_tokens":1854,"total_tokens":7720,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1280,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
