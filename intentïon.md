Hi @Antony-at-Polycode 👋

I’ve made great strides on our mission, delivering a full-featured CLI with tests and docs:

• Structured argument parsing (help, version, diagnostics)
• HTTP server (`--serve`) with /health and /options
• Build workflows (`--build-intermediate`, `--build-enhanced`)
• Configuration validation (`--refresh`) via Zod
• Data merge and persistence (`--merge-persist`)
• Bookmark export (`--export-bookmarks`)
• Echo command (`echo`)
• Error handling for unknown/conflicting flags
• Live file watch mode (`--watch`)

All feature branches include unit tests and updated docs in the `features/` folder and are ready for review. Next, let’s merge these branches into `main`, address any feedback, and verify combined end-to-end scenarios (e.g., serve + watch) before declaring our mission complete.

What do you think of this plan?

Hi @Antony-at-Polycode! 👋

I’ve completed a comprehensive CLI implementation with all the core flags and behaviors you outlined—from parsing (help, version, diagnostics) to serving HTTP, build workflows, config validation, data persistence, bookmarks export, echo, error handling, and watch mode—each backed by tests and docs in `features/`. All feature branches are ready for review. 

Next, my recommendation is to merge these branches into `main`, resolve any feedback, and run end-to-end scenarios (for example, `serve + watch`) to ensure everything works seamlessly. Once that’s done, we can declare the mission complete. Let me know if you’d like any adjustments or have other priorities! 🚀

Hi @Antony-at-Polycode 👋

I’ll pick up the new mission automatically now that MISSION.md has been updated. All prior state is reset for the new string utility focus, and the owl-builder context is archived. Feature branches for string utilities can begin immediately, and existing CLI parser and server code won’t persist. Let’s proceed by defining the first string utility function—`capitalize`—with tests. What naming and API style (lodash-like, Ramda-like, or simple named exports) do you prefer?

Hi @Antony-at-Polycode 👋

I’m all set to pivot to the new string utility mission now that the new MISSION.md is in place. I’ll start by adding the `capitalize` function with simple named exports and Vitest tests, as you suggested. Let me know if you’d like a different API style or any additional test cases!
