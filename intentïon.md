Generated issue 2256 for feature "cli-commands" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/2256

title:

Implement CLI subcommands: start, diagnostics, serve

And description:

We need to extend the existing `src/lib/main.js` entrypoint to support structured command-line subcommands and configurable behaviors as defined in `features/CLI_COMMANDS.md`. Specifically, implement the following:

1. **Command parsing and dispatch**
   - Use `process.argv` to capture the subcommand (default to `start` when none is provided).
   - Validate the subcommand against the allowed list (`start`, `diagnostics`, `serve`) using Zod. Unrecognized commands must throw an error with a descriptive message.

2. **Handler functions**
   - **start** (default): Preserve the existing behavior (log the provided arguments).
   - **diagnostics**: Print runtime environment details:
     - Node.js version (`process.version`)
     - OS platform (`process.platform`)
     - Current memory usage (`process.memoryUsage()`)
   - **serve**: Launch an HTTP server on port 3000:
     - Respond to `GET /health` with `{ status: 'ok' }` JSON payload.
     - Gracefully shut down the server on `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`.

3. **Tests** (`tests/unit/main.test.js`)
   - Verify that `diagnostics` command logs a string containing both the Node version and platform.
   - Confirm that `serve` command returns an HTTP server instance listening on port 3000 (use a mock or superagent to hit `/health`).
   - Ensure an unsupported subcommand throws an error with a clear message.
   - Retain and update the default `start`-behavior test to assert it logs the arguments correctly.

4. **Documentation** (`README.md`)
   - Add a new **CLI Usage** section demonstrating:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- diagnostics
     npm run start -- serve
     npm run start -- unsupported
     ```
   - Describe each available subcommand and its behavior.

5. **Scripts** (`package.json`)
   - Update `scripts.diagnostics` to `node src/lib/main.js diagnostics`.
   - Update `scripts.serve` to `node src/lib/main.js serve`.

**How to verify:**
- Run `npm test` to confirm all unit tests pass.
- Run `npm run start -- diagnostics` and observe the environment details.
- Run `npm run start -- serve` and send a `GET /health` request to `http://localhost:3000` returning `{ status: 'ok' }`.
- Run `npm run start -- invalid` to confirm it fails with the descriptive error.

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0/issues/ with enhanced description:

**Implement CLI Subcommands with Testable Acceptance Criteria**

We need to extend the existing `src/lib/main.js` entrypoint to support structured command-line subcommands and configurable behaviors as defined in `features/CLI_COMMANDS.md`. The implementation must satisfy the following acceptance criteria:

1. Command Parsing and Dispatch:
   - When no subcommand is provided (i.e., `node src/lib/main.js`), the default `start` handler is invoked and logs `Run with: []`.
   - When `node src/lib/main.js start arg1 arg2` is run, it logs `Run with: ["arg1","arg2"]`.
   - Unrecognized subcommands (e.g., `node src/lib/main.js invalid`) throw an error synchronously with the message: `Unrecognized command: invalid`.

2. Argument Validation:
   - Use Zod to validate that the subcommand is one of `start`, `diagnostics`, or `serve`.
   - On validation failure, the process must exit with a non-zero code and print a descriptive error.

3. Subcommand Handlers:
   a. start (default):
      - Preserves existing behavior of logging provided arguments.
   b. diagnostics:
      - Prints a single line string containing:
        - Node.js version (from `process.version`)
        - OS platform (from `process.platform`)
        - Memory usage object (from `process.memoryUsage()`)
      - Example output must match `/Node:\s*v\d+\.\d+\.\d+, Platform:\s*\w+, MemoryUsage: \{.*\}/`.
   c. serve:
      - Launches an HTTP server on port 3000.
      - Responds to `GET /health` with status code 200 and JSON payload `{ status: 'ok' }`.
      - Listens for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals and shuts down gracefully (server closes and process exits).

4. NPM Scripts:
   - Update `package.json`:
     - `"diagnostics"`: `node src/lib/main.js diagnostics`
     - `"serve"`: `node src/lib/main.js serve`

5. Tests (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):
   - Verify default start behavior logs `Run with: []` without error.
   - Test that `diagnostics` subcommand outputs a string containing Node version and platform.
   - Test that `serve` subcommand returns an HTTP server listening on port 3000 and GET `/health` returns `{ status: 'ok' }`.
   - Confirm that an unsupported subcommand throws an error with the message `Unrecognized command: <cmd>`.

6. Documentation (`README.md`):
   - Add a **CLI Usage** section demonstrating:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- diagnostics
     npm run start -- serve
     npm run start -- unsupported
     ```
   - Describe each subcommand and expected behavior.

**Verification Steps:**
- Run `npm test` to ensure all unit tests pass.
- Execute `npm run start`, `npm run start -- diagnostics`, `npm run start -- serve`, and `npm run start -- invalid` to validate real-world behavior matches acceptance criteria.
